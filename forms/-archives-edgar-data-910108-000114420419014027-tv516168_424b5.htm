agreements, dated as of January 11, 2013, as amended and restated on March 14, 2019, with each of Jefferies LLC and KeyBanc Capital
Markets Inc., which we refer to as the sales agents, relating to our shares of beneficial interest classified as common stock,
par value $0.0001 per share, which we refer to as common shares, offered by this prospectus supplement and the accompanying prospectus.
In accordance with the terms of these equity distribution agreements, as amended, we have increased the amount we may offer and
sell to up to an aggregate of $164,743,985 of our common shares from time to time through the sales agents as our agents. Prior
to the date of this prospectus supplement, we had already sold common shares having an aggregate offering price of approximately
$64,743,985 under the equity distribution agreements, resulting in an aggregate offering price of $100,000,000.00 of our common

this prospectus supplement and the accompanying prospectus may be made by means of ordinary brokers&rsquo; transactions on the
New York Stock Exchange in negotiated transactions or transactions that are deemed to be &ldquo;at-the-market&rdquo; offerings
as defined in Rule 415 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, including sales made through a market maker other than an
exchange, at prices related to the prevailing market prices or at negotiated prices. The sales agents are not required to sell
any specific number or dollar amount of common shares, but each sales agent will make all sales using commercially reasonable efforts
consistent with its normal trading and sales practices on mutually agreed terms between the sales agent and us. Our common shares
to which this prospectus supplement relates will be sold through only one sales agent on any given day. The offering of common
shares pursuant to the equity distribution agreements will terminate upon the earlier of (1) the sale of our common shares subject
to the equity distribution agreements having an aggregate offering price of $164,743,985, inclusive of the approximately $64,743,985
previously sold, and (2) the termination of the equity distribution agreements by us or the sales agents.</P>

<P STYLE="font: bold 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">We are a Maryland real estate investment
trust, qualified as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, that owns a portfolio of equity investments in single-tenant commercial
properties, with a focus on industrial properties. A majority of these properties are subject to net or similar leases, where the
tenant bears all or substantially all of the costs, including cost increases, for real estate taxes, utilities, insurance and ordinary
repairs. However, certain leases provide that the landlord is responsible for certain operating expenses.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">As of December 31, 2018, we had equity ownership
interests in approximately 135 consolidated real estate properties, located in 34 states and containing an aggregate of approximately
47.6 million square feet of space, approximately 95.1% of which was leased. In 2018, 2017 and 2016, no tenant/guarantor represented
greater than 10% of our annual base rental revenue.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">In addition to our shares of beneficial
interest, par value $0.0001 per share, classified as common stock, which we refer to as common shares, as of December 31, 2018,
we have one outstanding class of beneficial interest classified as preferred stock, or preferred shares, our 6.50% Series C Cumulative
Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.0001 per share, or our Series C Preferred Shares. Our common shares and Series C Preferred
Shares are traded on the New York Stock Exchange, or NYSE, under the symbols &ldquo;LXP&rdquo; and &ldquo;LXPPRC&rdquo;, respectively.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">We elected to be taxed as a REIT under Sections
856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, which we refer to as the Code, commencing with our taxable year
ended December 31, 1993. We intend to continue to qualify as a REIT. If we qualify for taxation as a REIT, we generally will not
be subject to federal corporate income taxes on our net taxable income that is currently distributed to our shareholders. We conduct
certain taxable activities through our taxable REIT subsidiary, Lexington Realty Advisors, Inc.</P>

risks. You should consider carefully the risks described and discussed under the caption &ldquo;Risk Factors&rdquo; included in
our Annual Report and in any other documents incorporated by reference in this prospectus supplement before making a decision to
purchase our common shares. These risk factors may be amended, supplemented or superseded from time to time by risk factors contained

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">This offering may have a dilutive effect
on our expected earnings per share and funds from operations per share for the year ending December 31, 2019 or in future years
when shares are sold pursuant to this offering. The actual amount of such dilution, if any, cannot be determined at this time and
will be based on numerous factors, including, without limitation, the amount of shares issued in this offering and the ultimate
application of the proceeds thereof. We are not restricted from issuing in the future additional common shares or preferred shares,
including any securities that are convertible into or exchangeable for, or that represent the right to receive, common shares or
preferred shares or any substantially similar securities. The market price of our common shares could decline as a result of sales
of a large number of our common shares in the market after this offering or the perception that such sales could occur.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">We maintain a direct share purchase plan,
pursuant to which we may issue additional common shares. In addition, as of March 12, 2019, an aggregate of 3.7 million of our
common shares were issuable upon the exercise of employee share options and upon the exchange of units in our operating partnership
subsidiary. We have also filed a universal shelf registration statement with the Commission pursuant to which we may sell additional
securities in the future. Depending upon the number of such securities issued, exercised or exchanged at one time, an issuance,
exercise or exchange of such securities could be dilutive to or otherwise adversely affect the interests of holders of our common
shares.</P>

on our common shares in the future, as well as the timing, amount and composition of any such future dividends, will be at the
sole discretion of our board of trustees in light of conditions then existing, including our earnings, financial condition, capital
requirements, debt maturities, the availability of debt and equity capital, applicable REIT and legal restrictions and the general
overall economic conditions and other factors. The actual dividend payable will be determined by our board of trustees based upon
the circumstances at the time of declaration and the actual dividend payable may vary from such expected amount. As previously
announced in 2018, we changed our dividend policy for our common shares to reduce the quarterly dividend amount as a result of
our strategy of investing primarily in industrial assets. Any change in our dividend policy could have a material adverse effect
on the market price of our common shares.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">We may in the future distribute taxable
dividends that are payable in shares. Taxable shareholders receiving such dividends will be required to include the full amount
of the dividend as ordinary income to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits for United States federal
income tax purposes. As a result, a U.S. shareholder may be required to pay income taxes with respect to such dividends even though
no cash dividends were received. If a U.S. shareholder sells the shares it receives as a dividend in order to pay this tax, the
sales proceeds may be less than the amount included in income with respect to the dividend, depending on the market price of the
shares at the time of the sale. Furthermore, with respect to non-U.S. shareholders, we may be required to withhold U.S. tax with
respect to such dividends. In addition, if a significant number of our shareholders determine to sell such shares received in a
dividend in order to pay taxes owed on such dividend, it may put downward pressure on the trading price of our common shares.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">From January 1, 2014 through the date of
this prospectus supplement, the closing sale price of our common shares on the NYSE (composite) has ranged from $11.69 to $6.61
per share. The market price of our common shares may fluctuate in response to company-specific and general market events and developments,
including those described in our Annual Report. In addition, our leverage may impact investor demand for our common shares, which
could have a material effect on the market price of our common shares.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">Furthermore, the public valuation of our
common shares is related primarily to the earnings that we derive from rental income with respect to the properties in which we
have an interest and not from the underlying appraised value of the properties themselves. As a result, interest rate fluctuations
and capital market conditions can affect the market value of our common shares. For instance, if interest rates rise, the market
price of our common shares may decrease because potential investors seeking a higher yield than they would receive from our common
shares may sell our common shares in favor of higher yielding securities.</P>

agreements, dated as of January 11, 2013, as amended on November 23, 2016 and amended and restated on March 14, 2019, with each
of Jefferies LLC and KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., which we refer to as the sales agents, under which we may issue and sell our
common shares from time to time through the sales agents. Sales of our common shares, if any, will be made by means of ordinary
brokers&rsquo; transactions on the NYSE, in negotiated transactions or transactions that are deemed to be &ldquo;at-the-market&rdquo;
offerings as defined in Rule 415 under the Securities Act, including sales made through market markers other than on an exchange,
at prices related to the prevailing marketed prices or at negotiated prices. Under the terms of each equity distribution agreement,
we also may sell our common shares to each of the sales agents, as principal for its own account, at a price to be agreed upon
at the time of sale. If we sell shares to either of the sales agents, as principal, we will enter into a separate terms agreement
with such sales agent and we will describe the agreement in a separate prospectus supplement or pricing supplement.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">When requested by us, the sales agents will
offer our common shares subject to the terms and conditions of the equity distribution agreements, which may be on a daily basis
for periods of time, or otherwise, or as we may otherwise agree with the sales agents. We will designate the maximum amount of
common shares to be sold through each sales agent. Each sales agent has agreed, subject to the terms and conditions of the equity
distribution agreements, to use its commercially reasonable efforts to place on our behalf all of the designated common shares.
On any given day, only one sales agent may sell the common shares to which this prospectus supplement and the accompanying prospectus
relate. We may instruct the sales agents not to place common shares at or below a price designated by us. We or the sales agents
may suspend the offering of common shares under the equity distribution agreements upon proper notice to the other party.</P>

up to 1.25% of the gross proceeds of any common shares sold through it pursuant to this prospectus supplement. We estimate that
the total expenses for the offering, excluding compensation payable to the sales agents under the terms of the equity distribution
