developing and commercializing novel treatments for patients suffering from skin diseases. We have developed a proprietary gene therapy platform, which we refer to as the Skin TARgeted Delivery platform, or
<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">STAR-D</FONT> platform, that consists of an engineered, patented (issued and pending), viral vector based on modified herpes simplex virus 1, or <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">HSV-1,</FONT> and skin-optimized gene
transfer technology, to develop <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">off-the-shelf</FONT></FONT> treatments for skin diseases for which we believe there are no known effective treatments. We are initially using our <FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">STAR-D</FONT> platform to develop treatments for rare or orphan dermatological indications caused by the absence of or a mutation in a single gene, and plan to leverage our platform in the future to expand our pipeline to
include other dermatological indications and skin conditions. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:3%; font-size:10pt; font-family:ARIAL">As of December&nbsp;31, 2018, we had an accumulated deficit of $20.0&nbsp;million. We
had a net loss of $10.9&nbsp;million for the fiscal year ended December&nbsp;31, 2018. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:ARIAL"><B>Recent Developments </B></P>

inauguration of Ancoris, a commercial scale current Good Manufacturing Practice, or cGMP, compliant manufacturing facility, following completion of a manufacturing trial run of KB103. We intend to use our cGMP manufacturing process for all clinical
and commercial production of KB103. Although we anticipate that our manufacturing facility will be the primary production site to meet project clinical and commercial demand, we will continue to evaluate, and will pursue as needed, additional
internal sources of manufacturing capacity, potential third parties to provide multiple long-term supply alternatives to meet commercial demand in the event that KB103 receives marketing approval and for our other pipeline programs. We continue to
utilize our internal process development group and work with third parties in order to evaluate and develop manufacturing process improvements that may increase the productivity and efficiency of our manufacturing process. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:3%; font-size:10pt; font-family:ARIAL"><I>Investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. Before deciding whether to invest in our common stock, you should carefully consider
the risks and uncertainties described below and under the section titled “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">10-K</FONT> for the fiscal year ended December&nbsp;31, 2018, as updated by our annual,
quarterly and other reports and documents that are incorporated by reference into this prospectus supplement and the accompanying prospectus and any free writing prospectus that we have authorized for use in connection with this offering. Each of
the risk factors could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition, as well as adversely affect the value of an investment in our common stock, and the occurrence of any of these risks might cause you to lose all or part
of your investment. There may be additional risks that we do not presently know of or that we currently believe are immaterial which could also impair our business and financial position. Please also read carefully the following section titled
“Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.” </I></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:ARIAL"><B>Risks Related to This Offering and Ownership of our Common Stock </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:ARIAL"><B><I>Our management will have broad discretion in the use of the net proceeds from this offering and may not use them effectively. </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:4pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:3%; font-size:10pt; font-family:ARIAL">Our management will have broad discretion in the application of the net proceeds from this offering and and could spend the proceeds in ways that do not
improve our business, financial condition or results of operations or enhance the value of our common stock. Our stockholders will not have the opportunity as part of their investment decision to assess whether the net proceeds are being used
appropriately. You may not agree with our decisions, and our use of the net proceeds may not yield any return on your investment. Because of the number and variability of factors that will determine our use of the net proceeds from this offering,
their ultimate use may vary substantially from their currently intended use. Our failure to apply the net proceeds of this offering effectively could compromise our ability to pursue our growth strategy and we might not be able to yield a
significant return, if any, on our investment of these net proceeds. You will not have the opportunity to influence our decisions on how to use our net proceeds from this offering. The failure by our management to apply these funds effectively could
result in financial losses that could harm our business, cause the price of our common stock to decline and delay the development of KB103, KB105 and any other product candidates we may develop. Pending their use, we may invest our cash, including
the net proceeds from this offering, in a manner that does not produce income or that loses value. See “Use of Proceeds.” </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:ARIAL"><B><I>If you purchase our
shares of our common stock in this offering, you will incur immediate and substantial dilution in the net tangible book value of your shares of our common stock. </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:4pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:3%; font-size:10pt; font-family:ARIAL">The shares of our common stock sold in this offering from time to time will be sold at various prices; however, we expect that the public offering price
of our common stock will be substantially higher than the net tangible book value per share of our common stock. Therefore, if you purchase shares of our common stock in this offering, you will pay a price per share that substantially exceeds our
net tangible book value per share after this offering and will suffer substantial dilution with respect to the net tangible book value of those shares of our common stock. Assuming that an aggregate of 2,414,292 shares of our common stock are sold
at a public offering price of $20.71 per share, the last reported sale price of our common stock on the Nasdaq on March&nbsp;11, 2019, for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $50,000,000, and after deducting estimated commissions and offering
expenses payable by us, you would incur immediate dilution of $11.12 per share, representing the difference between the assumed public offering price and our as adjusted net tangible book value per share, as of December&nbsp;31, 2018, of $9.59 after
giving effect to this offering. Further, the future exercise of any options or warrants to purchase shares of our common stock and the vesting and settlement of any restricted stock units will result in additional dilution of your investment. See
the section titled “Dilution” for a more detailed illustration of the dilution that you would incur if you participate in this offering. </P>

generate substantial product revenue, we expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings, strategic alliances, and license and development agreements or other collaborations. In addition, we may choose to
raise additional capital due to market conditions or strategic considerations even if we believe we have sufficient funds for our current or future operating plans. To the extent that we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities or
convertible debt securities, you may experience substantial additional dilution or result in downward pressure on the price of our common stock, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect
your rights as a common stockholder. Agreements for future debt or preferred equity financings, if available, may involve, covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital
expenditures, or declaring dividends. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:3%; font-size:10pt; font-family:ARIAL">If we raise additional funds through collaborations, strategic alliances or marketing, distribution or

of our common stock, or if the market perceived that any such stockholders or other executive officers or directors intends to sell shares of our common stock, such sale or perception could negatively affect our common stock price. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:3%; font-size:10pt; font-family:ARIAL">The amounts and timing of our use of the net proceeds from this offering will depend on a number of factors, including the timing and progress of our
research and development efforts, the timing and progress of any partnering and commercialization efforts, technological advances and the competitive environment for our products, as well as the amount of cash used in our operations. Although we
have no present intention or commitment to do so, we may use a portion of the net proceeds for the acquisition of, or investment in, technologies, intellectual property or businesses that complement our business. </P>

common stock sold in this offering and the net tangible book value per share of common stock immediately after this offering. Net tangible book value per share is determined by subtracting our total liabilities from the total book value of our
tangible assets and dividing the difference by the number of shares of common stock deemed to be outstanding at that date. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:3%; font-size:10pt; font-family:ARIAL">Our historical net
tangible book value as of December&nbsp;31, 2018 was approximately $113.2&nbsp;million, or $7.85 per share. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:3%; font-size:10pt; font-family:ARIAL">After giving effect to the assumed sale
of 2,414,292 shares of our common stock in this offering at an assumed offering price of $20.71 per share, the last reported sale price of our common stock on the Nasdaq on March&nbsp;11, 2019, and after deducting estimated commissions and offering
expenses payable by us, our as adjusted net tangible book value as of December&nbsp;31, 2018 would have been approximately $161.6 million, or $9.59 per share. This represents an immediate increase in as adjusted net tangible book value of $1.74 per
share to existing stockholders and immediate dilution of $11.12 per share to new investors purchasing shares of our common stock in this offering at the assumed offering price. </P>

on the actual public offering price, the actual number of shares sold and other terms of the offering determined at the time shares of our common stock are sold pursuant to this prospectus supplement. The pro forma as adjusted information assumes
that all shares of our common stock in the aggregate amount of $50,000,000 are sold at the assumed public offering price of $20.71 per share, the last reported sale price of our common stock on the Nasdaq on March&nbsp;11, 2019. The shares of our

<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:3%; font-size:10pt; font-family:ARIAL">We have entered into a sales agreement with Cowen, under which we may issue and sell from time to time up to $50,000,000 of our common stock through
Cowen as our sales agent. Sales of our common stock, if any, will be made at market prices by any method that is deemed to be an “at the market” offering as defined in Rule 415 under the Securities Act, including sales made directly on the
Nasdaq or any other trading market for our common stock. If authorized by us in writing, Cowen may purchase shares of our common stock as principal. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:3%; font-size:10pt; font-family:ARIAL">Cowen will offer our common stock subject to the terms and conditions of the sales agreement on a daily basis or as otherwise agreed upon by us and
Cowen. We will designate the maximum amount of common stock to be sold through Cowen on a daily basis or otherwise determine such maximum amount together with Cowen. Subject to the terms and conditions of the sales agreement, Cowen will use its
commercially reasonable efforts to sell on our behalf all of the shares of common stock requested to be sold by us. We may instruct Cowen not to sell common stock if the sales cannot be effected at or above the price designated by us in any such
instruction. Cowen or we may suspend the offering of our common stock being made through Cowen under the sales agreement upon proper notice to the other party. Cowen and we each have the right, by giving written notice as specified in the sales
agreement, to terminate the sales agreement in each party’s sole discretion at any time. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:3%; font-size:10pt; font-family:ARIAL">The aggregate compensation payable to Cowen as sales
agent equals 3.0% of the gross sales price of the shares sold through it pursuant to the sales agreement. We have also agreed to reimburse Cowen up to $50,000 of Cowen’s actual outside legal expenses incurred by Cowen in connection with this
offering and up to $10,000 of Cowen’s actual filing fees and associated legal expenses of Cowen’s outside counsel for filings with the FINRA Corporate Financing Department. We estimate that the total expenses of the offering payable by us,
excluding commissions payable to Cowen under the sales agreement, will be approximately $140,000. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:3%; font-size:10pt; font-family:ARIAL">The remaining sales proceeds, after deducting any
expenses payable by us and any transaction fees imposed by any governmental, regulatory, or self-regulatory organization in connection with the sales, will equal our net proceeds for the sale of such common stock. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:3%; font-size:10pt; font-family:ARIAL">Cowen will provide written confirmation to us following the close of trading on the Nasdaq on each day in which common stock is sold through it as sales
agent under the sales agreement. Each confirmation will include the number of shares of common stock sold through it as sales agent on that day, the volume weighted average price of the shares sold, the percentage of the daily trading volume and the
net proceeds to us. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:3%; font-size:10pt; font-family:ARIAL">We will report at least quarterly the number of shares of common stock sold through Cowen under the sales agreement, the net
proceeds to us and the compensation paid by us to Cowen in connection with the sales of common stock. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:3%; font-size:10pt; font-family:ARIAL">Settlement for sales of common stock will
occur, unless the parties agree otherwise, on the second business day that is also a trading day following the date on which any sales were made in return for payment of the net proceeds to us. There is no arrangement for funds to be received in an
escrow, trust or similar arrangement. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:3%; font-size:10pt; font-family:ARIAL">In connection with the sales of our common stock on our behalf, Cowen will be deemed to be an

Cowen against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. As sales agent, Cowen will not engage in any transactions that stabilizes our common stock. </P>

developed a proprietary gene therapy platform, our <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">STAR-D</FONT> platform, that consists of an engineered, patented (issued and pending), viral vector based on modified herpes simplex virus 1, or <FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">HSV-1,</FONT> and skin-optimized gene transfer technology, to develop <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">off-the-shelf</FONT></FONT> treatments for skin diseases for which we believe there
are no known effective treatments. We are initially using our <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">STAR-D</FONT> platform to develop treatments for rare or orphan dermatological indications caused by the absence of or a mutation in a single gene, and
plan to leverage our platform in the future to expand our pipeline to include other dermatological indications and skin conditions. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our
lead product candidate, KB103, seeks to use topical gene therapy to treat dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (“DEB”), a rare and severe genetic disease, for which there is currently no approved treatment. In May 2018, the first two patients
were enrolled in Phase 1/2 clinical study of KB103 at Stanford University, a <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">first-in-class</FONT></FONT> topical gene therapy for the treatment of DEB. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">KB103 is the first-ever topical <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">HSV-1</FONT> based gene therapy engineered to deliver a human collagen
protein to patients suffering from DEB. DEB affects the skin and mucosal tissues, and is caused by one or more mutations in a gene called COL7A1, which is responsible for the formation of protein type VII collagen, or COL7, that forms anchoring
fibrils that bind the dermis to the epidermis. In DEB patients, the genetic defect in COL7A1 results in loss or malfunctioning of these anchoring fibrils, leading to extremely fragile skin that blisters and tears from minor friction or trauma. Those
who are born with DEB are sometimes called “butterfly children”, because their skin is likened to be as fragile as the wings of a butterfly. DEB patients may suffer from open wounds, skin infections, fusion of fingers and toes, and
gastrointestinal tract problems throughout their lifetime, and may eventually develop squamous cell carcinoma, a potentially fatal condition. Based on information from DEBRA International, a worldwide alliance of patient support groups for EB, of
which DEB is a subset, we believe there may be as many as 125,000 patients worldwide who suffer from DEB. We estimate that there are 3,200 to 3,500 diagnosed DEB patients in the European Union (the “EU”), United States, Japan and Canada.

be able to obtain regulatory approval. Additional delays may result if an FDA Advisory Committee or other regulatory authority recommends <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-approval</FONT> or restrictions on approval. In addition, we may
experience delays or rejections based upon additional government regulation from future legislation or administrative action, or changes in regulatory authority policy during the period of product development, clinical trials and the review process.

limitations in the form of narrow indications, warnings or a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS. These regulatory authorities may require precautions or contra-indications with respect to conditions of use or they may grant approval
subject to the performance of costly post-marketing clinical trials. In addition, regulatory authorities may not approve the labeling claims that are necessary or desirable for the successful commercialization of KB103. Any of the foregoing
scenarios could materially harm the commercial prospects for KB103 and materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. </P>

ours can be more expensive and take longer than for other, better known or more extensively studied product candidates. To date, only two gene therapy products, Novartis’ Kymriah and Spark Therapeutics’s Luxurna, have received marketing

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Regulatory requirements governing gene and cell therapy products have changed frequently and may continue to change in the future. The FDA has
established the Office of Cellular, Tissue and Gene Therapies within its Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, or CBER, to consolidate the review of gene therapy and related products, and has established the Cellular, Tissue and Gene
Therapies Advisory Committee to advise CBER in its review. Gene therapy clinical trials conducted at institutions that receive funding for recombinant DNA research from the NIH, also are potentially subject to review by the NIH Office of
Biotechnology Activities’ RAC; however, the NIH recently announced that the RAC will only publicly review clinical trials if the trials cannot be evaluated by standard oversight bodies and pose unusual risks. Although the FDA decides whether
individual gene therapy protocols may proceed, the RAC public review process, if undertaken, can delay the initiation of a clinical trial, even if the FDA has reviewed the trial design and details and approved its initiation. Conversely, the FDA can
put an IND on a clinical hold even if the RAC has provided a favorable review or an exemption from <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">in-depth,</FONT> public review. If we were to engage an <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">NIH-funded</FONT>
institution to conduct a clinical trial, that institution’s IBC as well as its IRB, would need to review the proposed clinical trial to assess the safety of the trial. In addition, adverse developments in clinical trials of gene therapy
products conducted by others may cause the FDA or other oversight bodies to change the requirements for approval of our product candidates. Similarly, the EMA may issue new guidelines concerning the development and marketing authorization for gene
therapy medicinal products and require that we comply with these new guidelines. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">These regulatory review committees and advisory groups
and the new guidelines they promulgate may lengthen the regulatory review process, require us to perform additional studies, increase our development costs, lead to changes in regulatory positions and interpretations, delay or prevent approval and
commercialization of KB103 or future product candidates or lead to significant post-approval limitations or restrictions. As we advance KB103, we will be required to consult with these regulatory and advisory groups, and comply with applicable
guidelines. If we fail to do so, we may be required to delay or discontinue development of KB103. These additional processes may result in a review and approval process that is longer than we otherwise would have expected. Delay or failure to
obtain, or unexpected costs in obtaining, the regulatory approval necessary to bring a potential product to market could decrease our ability to generate sufficient product revenue, and our business, financial condition, results of operations and
prospects would be materially and adversely affected. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>KB103 may cause undesirable side effects or have other properties that could delay or prevent
its regulatory approval, limit the commercial potential or result in significant negative consequences following any potential marketing approval. </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">There have been several significant adverse side effects in gene therapy trials using other vectors in the past. Gene therapy is still a
relatively new approach to disease treatment and additional adverse side effects could develop. There also is the potential risk of delayed adverse events following exposure to gene therapy products due to persistent biologic activity of the genetic
material or other components of products used to carry the genetic material. Possible adverse side effects that could occur with treatment with gene therapy products include an immunologic reaction early after administration which, while not
necessarily adverse to the patient’s health, could substantially limit the effectiveness of the treatment. In previous clinical trials involving vectors derived from adeno-associated virus for gene therapy, some subjects experienced the
development of a <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-cell</FONT> response, whereby after the vector is within the target cell, the cellular immune response system triggers the removal of transduced cells by activated
<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-cells.</FONT> If our vectors demonstrate a similar effect we may decide or be required to halt or delay further clinical development of KB103. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition to side effects caused by the product candidate, the administration process or related procedures also can cause adverse side
effects. If any such adverse events occur, our clinical trials could be suspended or terminated. If in the future we are unable to demonstrate that such adverse events were caused by the administration process or related procedures, the FDA, the
European Commission, the EMA or other regulatory </P>

authorities could order us to cease further development of, or deny approval of, KB103 for any or all targeted indications. Even if we are able to demonstrate that any serious adverse events are
not product-related, such occurrences could affect patient recruitment or the ability of enrolled patients to complete the trial. Moreover, if we elect, or are required, to delay, suspend or terminate any clinical trial of KB103, the commercial
prospects of such product candidate may be harmed and our ability to generate product revenues from this product candidate may be delayed or eliminated. Any of these occurrences may harm our ability to develop other product candidates, and may harm
our business, financial condition and prospects significantly. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Additionally, if KB103 receives marketing approval, the FDA could require
us to adopt a REMS to ensure that the benefits outweigh its risks, which may include, among other things, a medication guide outlining the risks of the product for distribution to patients and a communication plan to health care practitioners.
Furthermore, if we or others later identify undesirable side effects caused by KB103, several potentially significant negative consequences could result, including: </P> <P STYLE="font-size:6pt;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt">&nbsp;</P>

clinical trials, or other clinical trials involving gene therapy products or our competitors’ products, even if not ultimately attributable to the relevant product candidates, and the resulting publicity, could result in increased government
regulation, unfavorable public perception, potential regulatory delays in the testing or approval of KB103, stricter labeling requirements for KB103 if approved and a decrease in demand for KB103. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>If the market opportunities for KB103 or our future product candidates are smaller than we believe they are, our product revenues may be adversely
affected and our business may suffer. </I></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We are currently focusing our research and product development efforts on KB103 for DEB. Our
understanding of both the number of people who have this disease, as well as the subset of people with this disease who have the potential to benefit from treatment with KB103, are based on estimates in published literature. These estimates may
prove to be incorrect and new studies may reduce the estimated incidence or prevalence of this disease. The number of patients in the United States, the EU and elsewhere may turn out to be lower than expected or these patients may not be otherwise
amenable to treatment with KB103 or may become increasingly difficult to identify and access, all of which would adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Further, there are several factors that could contribute to making the actual number of patients who receive KB103 less than the potentially
addressable market. These include the lack of widespread availability of, and limited reimbursement for, new therapies in many underdeveloped markets. Further, the severity of the progression of a disease up to the time of treatment will likely
diminish the therapeutic benefit conferred by a gene therapy due to irreversible cell damage. Lastly, certain patients’ immune systems might prohibit the successful delivery of certain gene therapy products to the target tissue, thereby
limiting the treatment outcomes. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>The commercial success of KB103 and any future product candidates will depend upon its degree of market acceptance
by physicians, patients, third-party payors and others in the medical community. </I></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Ethical, social and legal concerns about gene
therapy could result in additional regulations restricting or prohibiting KB103. Even with the requisite approvals from the FDA in the United States, the EMA in the EU and other regulatory authorities internationally, the commercial success of KB103
will depend, in part, on the acceptance of physicians, patients and health care payors of gene therapy products in general, and KB103 in particular, as medically necessary, cost-effective and safe. Any product that we commercialize may not gain
acceptance by physicians, patients, health care payors and others in the medical community. If these products do not achieve an adequate level of acceptance, we may not generate significant product revenue and may not become profitable. The degree
of market acceptance of gene therapy products and, in particular, KB103, if approved for commercial sale, will depend on several factors, including: </P> <P STYLE="font-size:6pt;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt">&nbsp;</P>

price that we intend to charge for our product candidates, if approved, is also subject to approval. We intend to submit a marketing authorization application to the EMA for approval of KB103 in the EU, but obtaining such approval from the European
Commission following the opinion of the EMA is a lengthy and expensive process. Even if a product candidate is approved, the FDA or the European Commission, as the case may be, may limit the indications for which the product may be marketed, require
extensive warnings on the product labeling or require expensive and time-consuming additional clinical trials or reporting as conditions of approval. Regulatory authorities in countries outside of the United States and the EU also have requirements

granted the Orphan Medicinal Product Designation, or OMPD, for KB103. On August&nbsp;9, 2018, the FDA granted orphan drug designation to our second product candidate, KB105, currently in preclinical development for treatment of patients with
transglutaminase 1 <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">(TGM-1)</FONT> deficient autosomal recessive congenital ichthyosis (“ARCI”). There are currently no treatments for ARCI, which affects approximately 20,000 patients worldwide. Regulatory
authorities in some jurisdictions, including the United States and the EU, may designate drugs for relatively small patient populations as orphan drugs. Under the Orphan Drug Act of 1983, the FDA may designate a product candidate as an orphan drug
if it is intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally defined as having a patient population of fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or a patient population greater than 200,000 in the United States where there
is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing the drug will be recovered from sales in the United States. In the EU, the EMA’s Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products grants orphan drug designation to promote the development of
products that are intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition affecting not more than 5 in 10,000 persons in the EU. Additionally, orphan designation is granted for products
intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening, seriously debilitating or serious and chronic condition and when, without incentives, it is unlikely that sales of the drug in the EU would be sufficient to justify the

designation or if the product is sufficiently profitable so that market exclusivity is no longer justified. Orphan drug exclusivity may be revoked if any regulatory agency determines that the request for designation was materially defective or if

partners, have substantially greater financial, technical and other resources, such as larger research and development, clinical, marketing and manufacturing organizations. Mergers and acquisitions in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries
may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of competitors. Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer or
less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any product candidate that we may develop. Competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly or earlier than we may obtain approval

obtain regulatory approval from FDA for our manufacturing process and facility. A manufacturing authorization must also be obtained from the appropriate EU regulatory authorities. The timeframe required for us to obtain such approvals is uncertain.
In addition, we must pass a <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">pre-approval</FONT> inspection of our manufacturing facility by the FDA before KB103 can obtain marketing approval. In order to obtain approval, we will need to ensure that all of our
processes, methods and equipment are compliant with cGMP, and perform extensive audits of vendors, contract laboratories and suppliers. If any of our vendors, contract laboratories or suppliers is found to be out of compliance with cGMP, we may
experience delays or disruptions in manufacturing while we work with these third parties to remedy the violation or while we work to identify suitable replacement vendors. The cGMP requirements govern quality control of the manufacturing process and
documentation policies and procedures. In complying with cGMP, we will be obligated to expend time, money and effort in production, record keeping and quality control to assure that the product meets applicable specifications and other requirements.
If we fail to comply with these requirements, we would be subject to possible regulatory action and may not be permitted to sell any product candidate that we may develop. </P>

produce sufficient quantities of KB103 for future clinical trials and initial U.S. commercial demand, we will need to increase the scale of our manufacturing process. The production of KB103 requires processing steps that are more complex than those
required for most chemical pharmaceuticals. Moreover, unlike chemical pharmaceuticals, the physical and chemical properties of a biologic such as ours generally cannot be fully characterized. As a result, assays of the finished product may not be
sufficient to ensure that the product will perform in the intended manner. Accordingly, we employ multiple steps to control our manufacturing process to assure that the process works and that KB103 is made strictly and consistently in compliance
with the process. Problems with the manufacturing process, even minor deviations from the normal </P>

third-party manufacturers do not successfully carry out their contractual duties, meet expected deadlines or manufacture KB103 in accordance with regulatory requirements or if there are disagreements between us and these third-party manufacturers,
we will not be able to complete, or may be delayed in completing, the preclinical studies required to support future IND submissions and the clinical trials required for approval of KB103. In such instances, we may need to locate an appropriate

the risk of fraud or other misconduct by our employees, principal investigators and advisors. Misconduct by these parties could include intentional failures to comply with FDA regulations or the regulations applicable in the EU and other
jurisdictions, provide accurate information to the FDA, the European Commission and other regulatory authorities, comply with healthcare fraud and abuse laws and regulations in the United States and abroad, report financial information or data
accurately or disclose unauthorized activities to us. In particular, sales, marketing and business arrangements in the healthcare industry are subject to extensive laws and regulations intended to prevent fraud, misconduct, kickbacks, self-dealing
and other abusive practices. These laws and regulations restrict or prohibit a wide range of pricing, discounting, marketing and promotion, sales commission, customer incentive programs and other business arrangements. Such misconduct also could
involve the improper use of information obtained in the course of clinical trials or interactions with the FDA or other regulatory authorities, which could result in regulatory sanctions and cause serious harm to our reputation. It is not always
possible to identify and deter employee misconduct, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from government investigations or other

receive compensation in connection with such services. Under certain circumstances, we may be required to report some of these relationships to the FDA. The FDA may conclude that a financial relationship between us and a principal investigator has
created a conflict of interest or otherwise affected interpretation of the trial. The FDA may therefore question the integrity of the data generated at the applicable clinical trial site and the utility of the clinical trial itself may be

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">For example, in March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by
the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or the PPACA, was passed, which substantially changes the way healthcare is financed by both the government and private insurers, and significantly impacts the U.S. pharmaceutical industry. The
PPACA, among other things: (i)&nbsp;addresses a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected; (ii)&nbsp;increases
the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and extends the rebate program to individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations; (iii)&nbsp;establishes annual fees and taxes on manufacturers of
certain branded prescription drugs; (iv)&nbsp;expands the availability of lower pricing under the 340B drug pricing program by adding new entities to the program; and (v)&nbsp;establishes a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which
manufacturers must agree to offer 50% <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">point-of-sale</FONT></FONT> discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period,
as a condition for the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Since its enactment, there have been
judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the PPACA. As a result, there have been delays in the implementation of, and action taken to repeal or replace, certain aspects of the PPACA. In January 2017, President Trump signed an
Executive Order directing federal agencies with authorities and responsibilities under the PPACA to waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay the implementation of any provision of the ACA that would impose a fiscal or regulatory burden on
states, individuals, healthcare providers, health insurers, or manufacturers of pharmaceuticals or medical devices. Further, in January 2017, Congress adopted a budget resolution for fiscal year 2017, or the Budget Resolution, that authorizes the
implementation of legislation that would repeal portions of the PPACA. Following the passage of the Budget Resolution, in March 2017, the U.S. House of Representatives introduced legislation known as the American Health Care Act, which, if enacted,
would amend or repeal significant portions of the PPACA. Among other changes, the American Health Care Act would repeal the annual fee on certain brand prescription drugs and biologics imposed on manufacturers and importers, eliminate penalties on
individuals and employers that fail to maintain or provide minimum essential coverage, and create refundable tax credits to assist individuals in buying health insurance. The American Health Care Act would also make significant changes to Medicaid
by, among other things, making Medicaid expansion optional for states, repealing the requirement that state Medicaid plans provide the same essential health benefits that are required by plans available on the exchanges, modifying federal funding,
including implementing a per capita cap on federal payments to states, and changing certain eligibility requirements. While it is uncertain when or if the provisions in the American Health Care Act will become law, or the extent to which any changes
may impact our business, it is clear that concrete steps are being taken to repeal and replace certain aspects of the PPACA. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Additionally, in the United States, the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 created an abbreviated approval pathway for
biologic products that are demonstrated to be “highly similar” or “biosimilar or interchangeable” with an <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">FDA-approved</FONT> biologic product. This new pathway could allow competitors to
reference data from biologic products already approved after 12 years from the time of approval. This could expose us to potential competition by lower-cost biosimilars even if we commercialize a product candidate faster than our competitors.
Moreover, the creation of this abbreviated approval pathway does not preclude or delay a third party from pursuing approval of a competitive product candidate via the traditional approval pathway based on their own clinical trial data. Other
legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the PPACA was enacted. For example, in August 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, created measures for spending reductions by Congress. A Joint
Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, tasked with recommending a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2012 through 2021, was unable to reach required goals, thereby triggering the legislation’s automatic reduction
to several government programs. This includes aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect in April 2013 and will remain in effect through 2025 unless additional Congressional action is
taken. In January 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to certain providers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers
from three to five years. Additionally, there have been several </P>

competitors, or other third parties, may be able to circumvent our patents by developing similar or alternative technologies or products in a <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-infringing</FONT> manner. Even assuming patents issue from our pending

Publications of discoveries in the scientific literature often lag behind their actual discoveries, and patent applications in the United States and other jurisdictions are typically not published until 18 months after filing or, in some cases, not
at all. Therefore, it is impossible to be certain that we were the first to develop the specific technologies as claimed in any owned patents or pending patent applications, or that we were the first to file for patent protection of such inventions.

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Filing, prosecuting and defending patents on product candidates in all countries throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive, and
intellectual property rights in some countries outside the United States may differ in scope from those eventually granted in the United States. Thus, in some cases, we will not have the opportunity to obtain patent protection for certain
technologies in some jurisdictions outside the United States. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as federal and state laws in the United States. Consequently, we may not be
able to prevent third parties from practicing our inventions in all countries outside the United States, even in jurisdictions where we do pursue patent protection. Competitors may use our technologies in jurisdictions where we have not pursued and
obtained patent protection to develop their own products and, further, may export otherwise infringing products to territories where we have patent protection, but enforcement is not as strong as that in the United States. These products may compete
with our product candidates, and our patents or other intellectual property rights may not be effective or sufficient to prevent them from competing. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Many companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in foreign jurisdictions. The
legal systems of certain countries, particularly certain developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents, trade secrets and other intellectual property protection, particularly those relating to biotechnology products. Such challenges
in enforcing rights in these countries could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents, if pursued and obtained, or marketing of competing products in violation of our proprietary rights generally. Proceedings to enforce our
future patent rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial costs and may divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business; could put our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly; could put any
future patent applications, including continuation and divisional applications, at risk of not issuing; and could provoke third parties to assert claims against us. We may not prevail in any lawsuits that we initiate, and the damages or other
remedies awarded, if any, may not be commercially meaningful. Accordingly, our efforts to enforce any intellectual property rights around the world stemming from intellectual property that we develop or license may be inadequate to obtain a
significant commercial advantage in these foreign jurisdictions. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our commercial success depends upon our ability (and the ability of any potential future collaborators) to develop, manufacture, market and
sell our product candidates, and to use our proprietary technologies without infringing the rights and intellectual property of others. Many companies and institutions have filed, and continue to file, patent applications related to various aspects
of gene therapy. Some of these patent applications have already been allowed or issued, while others may issue in the future. Since the areas of gene delivery and gene therapeutics are competitive and of strong interest to pharmaceutical and
biotechnology companies, there will likely be additional patent applications filed, and additional patents granted, in the future, as well as additional gene therapy research and development programs. Furthermore, because patent applications can
take many years to issue, may be confidential for 18 months or more after filing, and can be revised before issuance, there may be applications now pending which may later result in issued patents that a third party asserts are infringed by the
manufacture, use, sale, or importation of our products. The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by extensive and complex litigation regarding patents and other intellectual property rights. We may in the future become party
to, or be threatened with, adversarial proceedings or litigation regarding intellectual property rights with respect to KB103, KB105 or related technologies, including, for example, interference proceedings, post grant review challenges, and inter
partes review before the USPTO. Our competitors or other third parties may assert infringement claims against us, alleging that our therapeutics, manufacturing methods, formulations or administration methods are covered by their patents. Moreover,
we may face patent infringement claims from <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-practicing</FONT> entities that have no relevant product revenue, and against whom our licensed patent portfolio may therefore have no deterrent effect. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Third parties may assert infringement claims against us based on existing patents or patents that may be granted in the future, regardless of
their merit. There is a risk that third parties may choose to engage in litigation with us to enforce or to otherwise assert their patents or other intellectual property rights against us. Even if we believe such claims are without merit, a court of
competent jurisdiction could hold that these third-party patents are valid, enforceable and infringed, which could materially and adversely affect our ability to commercialize KB103. In order to successfully challenge the validity of any such U.S.
patent in federal court, we would need to overcome a presumption of validity. As this burden is a high, one requiring us to present clear and convincing evidence as to the invalidity of any such U.S. patent claim, there is no assurance that a court
of competent jurisdiction would invalidate the claims of any such U.S. patent. In such a hypothetical situation, there is no assurance that a court of competent jurisdiction would find that KB103 or our other product candidates or technologies do
not infringe a third-party patent. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Patent and other types of intellectual property litigation can involve complex factual and legal
questions, and their outcomes are uncertain. If we are found, or believe there is a risk that we may be found, to infringe a third party’s valid and enforceable intellectual property rights, we could be required (or may choose) to obtain a
license from such a third party to continue developing, manufacturing and marketing our technologies. However, we may not be able to obtain any required license on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. Even if we were able to obtain a license,
it could be <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-exclusive,</FONT> thereby giving our competitors and other third parties access to the same technologies licensed to us, and further, it could require us to make substantial licensing and royalty
payments. We could be forced, including by court order, to cease developing, manufacturing and commercializing the infringing technologies, including KB103. In addition, we could be found liable for monetary damages, including treble damages and
attorneys’ fees, if we are found to have willfully infringed a patent or other intellectual property right. A finding of infringement could prevent us from manufacturing and commercializing KB103, or force us to cease some or all of our
business operations. Claims that we have misappropriated the confidential information or trade secrets of third parties could have a similar negative impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. </P>

responsibilities. Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type
of litigation. In addition, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions, or other interim proceedings or developments, and if securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a

which we obtain access to third party intellectual property and to ensure that our employees and advisors do not use the proprietary information or <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">know-how</FONT> of others in their work for us, we may be subject to
claims that these individuals, or we, have used or disclosed intellectual property, including trade secrets or other proprietary information, of third parties or the current or former employers of employees or advisors. Litigation may be necessary
to defend against these claims. If we fail in defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel. Moreover, any such litigation, or the threat thereof, may adversely
affect our ability to hire new employees or contract with independent contractors. A loss of key personnel or their work product could hamper or prevent our ability to commercialize our technologies, which would have an adverse effect on our

execute agreements assigning such intellectual property rights to us, unforeseen complications may arise when fully and adequately executing such an agreement with each party who, in fact, conceives of intellectual property that we regard as our
own. Examples of such complications may include, for example, when we obtain agreements assigning intellectual property to us, the assignment of intellectual property rights may not be self-executing or the assignment agreements may be breached.
Such complications may lead to us being forced to bring claims against third parties, or defend claims that they may bring against us, to determine the ownership of what we regard as our intellectual property. Moreover, individuals executing

uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of patent applications and the enforcement or defense of issued patents. For example, on September&nbsp;16, 2011, the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, or the Leahy-Smith Act, was signed into law.
The Leahy-Smith Act included several significant changes to U.S. patent law, including provisions that affected the way patent applications are prosecuted, and altered strategies regarding patent litigation. These provisions also switched the United
States from a <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">“first-to-invent”</FONT></FONT> system to a <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">“first-to-file”</FONT></FONT> system,
allowed third-party submission of prior art to the USPTO during patent prosecution, and set forth additional procedures to attack the validity of a patent through various post grant proceedings administered by the USPTO. As patent reform legislation
can inject serious uncertainty into the patent prosecution and litigation processes, it is not clear what impact future patent reform legislation will have on the operation of our business. However, such future legislation, and its implementation,
could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of any issued patents, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results

and pharmaceuticals are particularly uncertain given the ever evolving and constantly shifting nature of precedential patent cases decided by both the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit and the U.S. Supreme Court. For instance, two cases
involving diagnostic method claims and “gene patents” have recently been decided by the Supreme Court. On March&nbsp;20, 2012, the Supreme Court issued a decision in Mayo Collaborative Services v. Prometheus Laboratories, Inc., or
Prometheus, a case involving patent claims directed to a process of measuring a metabolic product in a patient to optimize a drug dosage for the patient. According to the Supreme Court, the addition of well-understood, routine or conventional
activity such as “administering” or “determining” steps was not enough to transform an otherwise patent-ineligible natural phenomenon into patent-eligible subject matter. On July&nbsp;3, 2012, the USPTO issued a guidance memo to
patent examiners indicating that process claims directed to a law of nature, a natural phenomenon or a naturally occurring relation or correlation that do not include additional elements or steps that integrate the natural principle into the claimed
invention such that the natural principle is practically applied (and thus, the claim amounts to significantly more than the natural principle itself) should be rejected as directed to patent-ineligible subject matter. On June&nbsp;13, 2013, the
Supreme Court issued its decision in Association for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics, Inc., or Myriad, a case involving patent claims held by Myriad Genetics, Inc. relating to the breast cancer susceptibility genes BRCA1 and BRCA2. In its
decision, the US Supreme Court held that an isolated segment of naturally occurring DNA, such as the DNA constituting the BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes, is not patent eligible subject matter; however, complementary DNA may be patent eligible. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Although the Supreme Court held in Myriad that isolated segments of naturally occurring DNA are not patent-eligible subject matter, certain
third parties could allege that potential activities that we undertake in the future may infringe other gene-related patent claims, and we may deem it necessary to defend ourselves against these claims by asserting
<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-infringement</FONT> and/or invalidity positions, or paying to obtain a license to these claims. In any situation involving third-party intellectual property rights, such as those directed to gene-related patent
claims, if we are unsuccessful in defending against claims of patent infringement (<I>e.g., </I>by asserting invalidity of the infringed patent in view of the Supreme Court’s Myriad decision), we could be forced to pay damages or be subjected
to an injunction that would prevent us from utilizing the patented subject matter. Such outcomes could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects. </P>

or revised accounting standards. This allows an emerging growth company to delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have irrevocably elected not to avail ourselves of
this exemption from new or revised accounting standards and, therefore, we will be subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies. </P>

growth company, we will incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company. In addition, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and rules subsequently implemented by the SEC and NASDAQ have imposed various requirements
on public companies, including establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure and financial controls and corporate governance practices. Our management and other personnel will need to devote a substantial amount of time to these compliance
initiatives. Moreover, these rules and regulations will increase our legal and financial compliance costs and will make some activities more time consuming and costly. For example, we expect that these rules and regulations may make it more
difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Pursuant to Section&nbsp;404, we will be required
to furnish a report by our management on our internal control over financial reporting, including an attestation report on internal control over financial reporting issued by our independent registered public accounting firm. However, while we
remain an emerging growth company, we will not be required to include an attestation report on internal control over financial reporting issued by our independent registered public accounting firm. To achieve compliance with Section&nbsp;404 within
the prescribed period, we will be engaged in a process to document and evaluate our internal control over financial reporting, which is both costly and challenging. In this regard, we will need to continue to dedicate internal resources, potentially
engage outside consultants and adopt a detailed work plan to assess and document the adequacy of internal control over financial reporting, continue steps to improve control processes as appropriate, validate through testing that controls are
functioning as documented and implement a continuous reporting and improvement process for internal control over financial reporting. Despite our efforts, there is a risk that neither we nor our independent registered public accounting firm will be
able to conclude within the prescribed timeframe that our internal control over financial reporting is effective as required by Section&nbsp;404. This could result in an adverse reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of confidence in the
reliability of our financial statements. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Provisions in our corporate charter documents and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of us,

negotiate first with our board of directors. We believe that the benefits of increased protection of our potential ability to negotiate with an unfriendly or unsolicited acquirer outweigh the disadvantages of discouraging a proposal to acquire us

Private Placement, to have such registration statement declared effective within the time period set forth in the Purchase Agreement, and to keep such registration statement effective for up to three years. The 625,000 shares of our common stock

accordance with Regulation M under the Exchange Act. Over-allotment involves sales in excess of the offering size, which create a short position. Stabilizing transactions permit bids to purchase the underlying security so long as the stabilizing
bids do not exceed a specified maximum price. Syndicate-covering or other short-covering transactions involve purchases of the securities, either through exercise of the over-allotment option or in the open market after the distribution is
completed, to cover short positions. Penalty bids permit the underwriters to reclaim a selling concession from a dealer when the securities originally sold by the dealer are purchased in a stabilizing or covering transaction to cover short
positions. Those activities may cause the price of the securities to be higher than it would otherwise be. If commenced, the underwriters may discontinue any of the activities at any time. </P>

comply with applicable volume and price limitations and must be identified as passive market makers. In general, a passive market maker must display its bid at a price not in excess of the highest independent bid for such security; if all
independent bids are lowered below the passive market maker’s bid, however, the passive market maker’s bid must then be lowered when certain purchase limits are exceeded. Passive market making may stabilize the market price of the
