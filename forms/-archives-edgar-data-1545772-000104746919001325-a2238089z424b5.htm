<P style="font-family:times;text-align:justify"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NOI
is a key indicator of our ability to impact the operating performance of our properties. We seek to grow NOI through proactive management and leasing of our properties. Same-property
NOI in our Core Office
and Core Retail segments allows us to segregate the impact of leasing and operating initiatives on the portfolio from the impact of investing activities and "one-time items", which for the historical
periods presented consist primarily of lease termination income. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;text-align:justify"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
also consider FFO an important measure of our operating performance. FFO is a widely recognized measure that is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested
parties in the evaluation of real estate entities, particularly those that own and operate income producing properties. Our definition of FFO includes all of the adjustments that are outlined in the
National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B>NAREIT</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>") definition of FFO, including the exclusion of gains (or&nbsp;losses) from the sale of
investment properties, the add back of any depreciation and amortization related to real estate assets and the adjustment for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. In addition to the
adjustments prescribed by NAREIT, we also make adjustments to exclude any unrealized fair value gains (or&nbsp;losses) that arise as a result of reporting under IFRS, and income taxes that arise as
certain of our subsidiaries are structured as corporations as opposed to real estate investment trusts ("</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B>REIT</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>s"). These additional adjustments result in
an FFO measure that is similar to that which would result if our partnership was organized as a REIT that determined net income in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the
United&nbsp;States ("</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B>U.S.&nbsp;GAAP</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>"), which is the type of organization on which the NAREIT definition is premised. Our FFO measure will differ
from other organizations applying the NAREIT definition to the extent of certain differences between the IFRS and U.S.&nbsp;GAAP reporting frameworks, principally related to the timing of revenue
recognition from lease terminations and sale of properties. Because FFO excludes fair value gains (losses), including equity accounted fair value gains (losses), realized gains (losses) on the sale of
investment properties, depreciation and amortization of real estate assets and income taxes, it provides a performance measure that, when compared year-over-year, reflects the impact on operations
from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs and interest costs, providing perspective not immediately apparent from net&nbsp;income. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;text-align:justify"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
addition, we consider Company FFO a useful measure for securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of our partnership's performance. Company FFO,
similar to FFO discussed above, provides a performance measure that reflects the impact on operations of trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs and interest costs. In addition, the
adjustments to Company FFO relative to FFO allow the partnership insight into these trends for the real estate operations, by adjusting for non-real estate components. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;text-align:justify"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Net
income attributable to unitholders and equity attributable to unitholders, each as defined above, are used by our company to evaluate the performance of our company as a whole as
each of our unitholders participates in the economics of our company equally. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;text-align:justify"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For
a reconciliation of NOI, FFO, Company FFO, and net income attributable to unitholders to net income (loss), and a reconciliation of equity attributable to unitholders to total
equity, see Item&nbsp;5.A. "Operating and Financial Review and Prospects&nbsp;—&nbsp;Operating Results&nbsp;—&nbsp;Financial Statements
Analysis&nbsp;—&nbsp;Review of Consolidated Results&nbsp;—&nbsp;Reconciliation of Non-IFRS Measures" in our Annual Report on Form&nbsp;20-F
for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2018, which is incorporated herein by reference. We urge you to review the IFRS financial measures in our Annual Report, including the financial statements, the
notes thereto and the other financial information contained herein, and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our&nbsp;company. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;text-align:justify"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An investment in our Series&nbsp;1 Preferred Units involves risks. You should carefully consider all of the information contained in
this prospectus supplement, the accompanying base prospectus and the documents incorporated by reference as provided under "Documents Incorporated by Reference," including our Annual Report on
Form&nbsp;20-F for the fiscal year ended December&nbsp;31, 2018, dated March&nbsp;1, 2019, and the risk factors described under "Risk Factors" therein. This prospectus supplement, the
accompanying base prospectus and the documents incorporated by reference also contain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Please read "Cautionary Statement Regarding
Forward-Looking Information" herein. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including the risks described
elsewhere in this prospectus supplement, in the accompanying base prospectus and in the documents incorporated by reference. If any of these risks occur, our business, financial condition, results of
operations, liquidity and the market price of the Series&nbsp;1 Preferred Units could be adversely affected. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;text-align:justify"><FONT SIZE=2><B> Risks Related to the Series&nbsp;1 Preferred Units  </B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;text-align:justify"><FONT SIZE=2><B><I> The Series&nbsp;1 Preferred Units represent perpetual interests in us, and investors should not expect us to redeem any Series&nbsp;1 Preferred Units on the date the
Series&nbsp;1 Preferred Units become redeemable by us or on any particular date thereafter.  </I></B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;text-align:justify"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Series&nbsp;1 Preferred Units represent perpetual interests in us, and they have no maturity or mandatory redemption date and are
not redeemable at the option of investors under any circumstances. As a result, unlike our indebtedness, none of the Series&nbsp;1 Preferred Units will give rise to a claim for payment of a
principal amount at a particular date. Instead, the Series&nbsp;1 Preferred Units may be redeemed by us at our option (i)&nbsp;following the occurrence of a Change of Control Triggering Event, a
Delisting Brookfield Transaction Triggering Event, and/or a Change in Tax Law, in whole, out of funds legally available for such redemption, at a redemption price in cash of $25.00 per Series&nbsp;1
Preferred Unit plus an amount equal to all accumulated and unpaid distributions thereon to, but excluding, the date of redemption, whether or not declared, (ii)&nbsp;prior to March&nbsp;31, 2024,
following the occurrence of a Ratings Event, in whole but not in part, out of funds legally available for such redemption, at a redemption price in cash of $25.50 per Series&nbsp;1 Preferred Unit
plus an amount equal to all accumulated and unpaid distributions thereon to, but excluding, the date of redemption, whether or not declared, or (iii)&nbsp;at any time on or after March&nbsp;31,
2024, at our option, in whole or in part, out of funds legally available for such redemption, at a redemption price in cash of $25.00 per Series&nbsp;1 Preferred Unit plus an amount equal to all
accumulated and unpaid distributions thereon to, but excluding, the date of redemption, whether or not declared. Any decision we may make at any time to redeem the Series&nbsp;1 Preferred Units will
depend upon, among other things, our evaluation of our capital position, the terms and circumstances of any Change of Control, Ratings Event or Delisting Brookfield Transaction, as applicable, and
general market conditions at that time. The instruments governing our outstanding indebtedness also may limit our ability to redeem the Series&nbsp;1 Preferred Units. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;text-align:justify"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any
decision we may make at any time to redeem the Series&nbsp;1 Preferred Units will be determined by the board of directors of the BPY General Partner in its sole discretion and will
depend upon, among other things, an evaluation of our capital position, the composition of our equity, our outstanding indebtedness and general market conditions at that time. As a result, the holders
of the Series&nbsp;1 Preferred Units may be required to bear the financial risks of an investment in the Series&nbsp;1 Preferred Units for an indefinite period of time. The Series&nbsp;1
Preferred Units will also rank junior to all of our existing and future indebtedness with respect to assets available to satisfy claims against&nbsp;us. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;text-align:justify"><FONT SIZE=2><B><I> The Series&nbsp;1 Preferred Units are subordinated to our existing and future debt obligations and Senior Securities, as well as existing and future debt obligations of

<P style="font-family:times;text-align:justify"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Series&nbsp;1 Preferred Units are subordinated to all of our existing and future indebtedness and Senior Securities. As of

<P style="font-family:times;text-align:justify"><FONT SIZE=2>may
incur additional debt under our credit facilities, or other existing or future debt arrangements. The payment of principal and interest on our debt reduces cash available for distribution to our
limited partners, including the holders of the Series&nbsp;1 Preferred Units. In addition, the Series&nbsp;1 Preferred Units will be structurally subordinated to all existing and future debt
obligations of our subsidiaries and any capital stock of our subsidiaries held by others as to the payment of distributions and amounts payable upon a liquidation event, including series of
class&nbsp;A preferred units of the Property Partnership that are held by third&nbsp;parties. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;text-align:justify"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
issuance of any Senior Securities or additional Parity Securities (including additional Series&nbsp;1 Preferred Units and any other obligations of BPY that ranks on parity with the
Series&nbsp;1 Preferred Units, including the BPY Guarantee) would dilute the interests of the holders of the Series&nbsp;1 Preferred Units and could affect our ability to pay distributions on,
redeem, or pay the liquidation preference on the Series&nbsp;1 Preferred Units. Future issuances and sales of Senior Securities, Parity Securities, Junior Securities or obligations similar to the
BPY Guarantee, or the perception that such issuances and sales could occur, may cause prevailing market prices for the Series&nbsp;1 Preferred Units to decline and may adversely affect our ability
to raise additional capital in the financial markets at times and prices favorable to&nbsp;us. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;text-align:justify"><FONT SIZE=2><B><I> The declaration of distributions on the Series&nbsp;1 Preferred Units will be at the discretion of the BPY General Partner.  </I></B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;text-align:justify"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The declaration of distributions on the Series&nbsp;1 Preferred Units will be at the discretion of the BPY General Partner. Holders
of Series&nbsp;1 Preferred Units will not have a right to distributions on such units unless declared by the BPY General Partner. The declaration of distributions will be at the discretion of the
BPY General Partner even if our company has sufficient funds, net of its liabilities, to pay such distributions. This may result in holders of the Series&nbsp;1 Preferred Units not receiving the
full amount of distributions that they expect to receive, or any distributions, and may make it more difficult to resell Series&nbsp;1 Preferred Units or to do so at a price that the holder finds
attractive. The BPY General Partner will not allow our company to pay a distribution (i)&nbsp;unless there is sufficient cash available, (ii)&nbsp;which would render our company unable to pay our
debts as and when they come due, or (iii)&nbsp;which, in the opinion of the BPY General Partner, would or might leave our company with insufficient funds to meet
any future or contingent obligations. In addition, although unpaid distributions are cumulative, we are not required to accumulate cash for purpose of making distributions to holders of the
Series&nbsp;1 Preferred Units, which may limit the cash available to make distributions on the Series&nbsp;1 Preferred Units. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;text-align:justify"><FONT SIZE=2><B><I> The Series&nbsp;1 Preferred Units have extremely limited voting rights.  </I></B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;text-align:justify"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Except as set forth in our Partnership Agreement or as otherwise required by Bermuda law, holders of the Series&nbsp;1 Preferred
Units generally will have no voting rights. For example, the company may sell, exchange or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its assets in a single transaction or a series of related
transactions without the approval of holders of the Series&nbsp;1 Preferred Units. Although the holders of the Series&nbsp;1 Preferred Units are entitled to limited protective voting rights with
respect to certain matters, as described in "Description of the Offered Securities&nbsp;—&nbsp;Description of Series&nbsp;1 Preferred
Units&nbsp;—&nbsp;Voting Rights," the Series&nbsp;1 Preferred Units will generally vote as a separate class, or along with all other classes or series of our Parity
Securities that we may issue upon which like voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable. As a result, the voting rights of holders of Series&nbsp;1 Preferred Units may be significantly
diluted, and the holders of such other classes or series of Parity Securities that we may issue may be able to control or significantly influence the outcome of any&nbsp;vote. </FONT></P>

Series&nbsp;1 Preferred Units to be issued in connection with this offering may be amended by the Property Partnership, which we control, in a manner that could be detrimental to holders of

terms of the Property Partnership Mirror Units will provide that no distribution may be declared or paid or set apart for payment on any Mirror Junior Securities (as&nbsp;defined
in "Description of the Offered Securities&nbsp;—&nbsp;Description of Series&nbsp;1 Preferred Units&nbsp;—&nbsp;Property Partnership Mirror
Units") (other than a distribution payable solely in Mirror Junior Securities) unless full cumulative distributions have been or contemporaneously are being paid or provided for on all outstanding
Property Partnership Mirror Units and any Mirror Parity Securities (as&nbsp;defined in "Description of the Offered

respective distribution payment dates. To the extent a distribution period applicable to a class of Mirror Junior Securities or Mirror Parity Securities is shorter than the distribution period
applicable to the Property Partnership Mirror Units (</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>e.g.</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>, monthly rather than quarterly), we may declare and pay regular distributions with respect to
such Mirror Junior Securities or Mirror Parity Securities so long as, at the time of declaration of such distribution, we expect to&nbsp;have sufficient funds to pay the full distribution in respect

<P style="font-family:times;text-align:justify"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
terms of the Property Partnership Mirror Units are intended, among others, to provide credit support to the Series&nbsp;1 Preferred Units. However, the Property Partnership will
have no direct obligations with respect to our Series&nbsp;1 Preferred Units. The Property Partnership, which is controlled by us, may amend, modify or alter the terms of the Property Partnership
Mirror Units, including with respect to distributions, in a manner that would be detrimental to the holders of the Series&nbsp;1 Preferred Units. In addition, subject to the terms of the limited
partnership agreement of the Property Partnership (the&nbsp;"</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B>Property Partnership Agreement</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>"), the Property Partnership may in the future issue
securities that are on parity with or senior to the Property Partnership Mirror Units. Any of the foregoing actions could materially and adversely affect the market price of the Series&nbsp;1
Preferred Units. Accordingly, the terms of the Property Partnership Mirror Units should not be relied upon to ensure we have sufficient cash flows to enable us to pay distributions on or redeem the
Series&nbsp;1 Preferred Units. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;text-align:justify"><FONT SIZE=2><B><I> The terms of our current and future indebtedness currently do or may restrict our ability to make distributions on the Series&nbsp;1 Preferred Units or to redeem the

<P style="font-family:times;text-align:justify"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Distributions will only be paid if the distribution is not restricted or prohibited by law or the terms of any Senior Securities,
including our current and future indebtedness. The instruments governing the terms of current or future financing or the refinancing of any borrowings currently do or may contain covenants that
restrict our ability to make distributions on the Series&nbsp;1 Preferred Units or redeem the Series&nbsp;1 Preferred Units. The Series&nbsp;1 Preferred Units place no restrictions on our
ability to incur indebtedness containing such restrictive covenants. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;text-align:justify"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
have been advised by the underwriters that they intend to make a market in the Series&nbsp;1 Preferred Units pending any listing of the Series&nbsp;1 Preferred Units on Nasdaq,

<P style="font-family:times;text-align:justify"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the factors that will influence the price of the Series&nbsp;1 Preferred Units will be the distribution yield on the
Series&nbsp;1 Preferred Units (as&nbsp;a percentage of the price of the Series&nbsp;1 Preferred Units) relative to market interest rates. An increase in market interest rates, which are
currently at low levels relative to historical rates, may lead prospective purchasers of the Series&nbsp;1 Preferred Units to expect a higher distribution yield, and higher interest rates would
likely increase our borrowing costs and potentially decrease funds available for distribution to our limited partners, including the holders of the Series&nbsp;1 Preferred Units. Accordingly, higher
market interest rates could cause the market price of the Series&nbsp;1 Preferred Units to&nbsp;decrease. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;text-align:justify"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We

<P style="font-family:times;text-align:justify"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On or after March&nbsp;31, 2024, we will have the right, at our option, to redeem at a price of $25.00 per Series&nbsp;1 Preferred
Unit, plus an amount equal to all accumulated and unpaid distributions thereon to, but excluding, the date fixed for redemption, whether or not declared, some or all of the Series&nbsp;1 Preferred
Units, as defined and described under "Description of the Offered Securities&nbsp;—&nbsp;Description of Series&nbsp;1 Preferred
Units&nbsp;—&nbsp;Redemption&nbsp;—&nbsp;Optional Redemption on or after March&nbsp;31, 2024." In addition, prior to March&nbsp;31, 2024, we

Securities&nbsp;—&nbsp;Description of Series&nbsp;1 Preferred Units&nbsp;—&nbsp;Redemption&nbsp;—&nbsp;Optional
Redemption upon a Ratings Event", at a price of $25.50 per Series&nbsp;1 Preferred Unit, plus declared and unpaid distributions. We will also be able to redeem all but not less than all of the
Series&nbsp;1 Preferred Units following the occurrence of a Change of Control Triggering Event, a Delisting Brookfield Transaction Triggering Event and/or a Change in Tax Law out of funds legally
available for such redemption, at a redemption price in cash of $25.00 per Series&nbsp;1 Preferred Unit plus an amount equal to all accumulated and unpaid distributions thereon to, but excluding,
the date of redemption, whether or not declared. To the extent that we redeem the Series&nbsp;1 Preferred Units at times when prevailing interest rates may be relatively low compared to rates at the
time of issuance of the Series&nbsp;1 Preferred Units, you may not be able to reinvest the redemption proceeds in a comparable security at an effective interest rate as high as the distribution rate
of the Series&nbsp;1 Preferred Units. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;text-align:justify"><FONT SIZE=2><B><I> Upon a Change of Control Triggering Event or a Delisting Brookfield Transaction Triggering Event, we are not required to redeem the Series&nbsp;1 Preferred Units, and we

<P style="font-family:times;text-align:justify"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are not required to redeem the Series&nbsp;1 Preferred Units, and even if we should decide to redeem the Series&nbsp;1 Preferred
Units, since the Series&nbsp;1 Preferred Units will rank junior to all
of our existing and future indebtedness, upon a Change of Control Triggering Event or a Delisting Brookfield Transaction Triggering Event, we may not have sufficient financial resources available or
be permitted under our existing and future indebtedness to redeem the Series&nbsp;1 Preferred Units, or pay the increased distribution rate per annum described under "Description of the Offered
Securities&nbsp;—&nbsp;Description of Series&nbsp;1 Preferred Units&nbsp;—&nbsp;Redemption&nbsp;—&nbsp;Optional
Redemption upon a Change of Control Triggering Event" and "—&nbsp;Optional Redemption upon a Delisting Brookfield Transaction Triggering Event." Even if we are able to pay the
increased distribution rate per annum, increasing the per annum distribution rate by 5.00% may not be sufficient to compensate holders for the impact of the Change of Control Triggering Event or a
Delisting Brookfield Transaction Triggering Event on the market price of the Series&nbsp;1 Preferred Units. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;text-align:justify"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The U.S.&nbsp;federal income tax treatment of distributions on the Series&nbsp;1 Preferred Units is uncertain. We will treat

Holder will recognize taxable income from the accrual of such a guaranteed payment even in the absence of a contemporaneous cash distribution, we anticipate accruing and making

allocate any share of our nonrecourse liabilities, if any, to the holders of Series&nbsp;1 Preferred Units. Upon the sale of Series&nbsp;1 Preferred Units, a U.S.&nbsp;Preferred Holder will be
required to recognize gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized by such holder and such holder's tax basis in the Series&nbsp;1 Preferred Units sold. The amount realized
generally will equal the sum of the cash and the fair market value of other property such holder receives in exchange for such Series&nbsp;1 Preferred Units. Subject to general rules requiring a
blended tax basis among multiple partnership interests (including LP&nbsp;Units), the tax basis of a Series&nbsp;1 Preferred Unit generally will be equal to the sum of the cash and the fair market

("</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B>CFC</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>"). Based on our treatment of distributions on Series&nbsp;1 Preferred Units as guaranteed payments for the use of capital, we intend to take the
position that the PFIC and CFC rules generally do not apply to a U.S.&nbsp;Preferred Holder whose indirect interest in a PFIC or CFC arises solely by reason of owning our Series&nbsp;1 Preferred
Units. However, the treatment of&nbsp;preferred partnership interests under the PFIC and CFC rules is uncertain. There can be no assurance that the IRS or a court will not treat a
U.S.&nbsp;Preferred Holder as subject to the PFIC or CFC rules that apply to U.S.&nbsp;holders of partnership interests in our company generally. In such case, an investment by a
U.S.&nbsp;Preferred Holder in our Series&nbsp;1 Preferred Units may produce taxable income that is not related to distributions on such units, and such holder may be required to take such income
into account in determining such holder's gross income subject to tax. In addition, with respect to gain realized upon the direct or indirect sale of, and excess distributions from, a PFIC for which
an election for current inclusions is not made, such income would be taxable at ordinary income rates and subject to an additional tax equivalent to an interest charge on the deferral of income
inclusions from the PFIC. Further, all or a portion of any gain realized upon the direct or indirect sale of a CFC may be taxable at ordinary income rates. For these and other PFIC and CFC
consequences generally applicable to U.S.&nbsp;holders of partnership interests in our company generally, see "—&nbsp;Consequences to
U.S.&nbsp;Holders&nbsp;—&nbsp;Passive Foreign Investment Companies" and "—&nbsp;Consequences to
U.S.&nbsp;Holders&nbsp;—&nbsp;Controlled Foreign Corporations" in Item&nbsp;10.E "Taxation&nbsp;—&nbsp;U.S.&nbsp;Tax Considerations" in
our most recent Annual Report on Form&nbsp;20-F for the fiscal year ended December&nbsp;31, 2018, dated March&nbsp;1,&nbsp;2019. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;text-align:justify"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Investment
in the Series&nbsp;1 Preferred Units by Non-U.S.&nbsp;Preferred Holders (as&nbsp;defined below) gives rise to tax issues unique to such holders. We will treat
distributions on the Series&nbsp;1 Preferred Units as guaranteed payments made from sources outside the United&nbsp;States for U.S.&nbsp;federal income tax purposes, and we generally do not
expect to withhold U.S.&nbsp;federal income tax on such guaranteed payments made to Non-U.S.&nbsp;Preferred Holders, provided that we are not engaged in a trade or business within the
United&nbsp;States. However, the tax treatment of guaranteed payments for source and withholding tax purposes is uncertain, and the IRS may disagree with this treatment. As a result, it is possible
that the IRS could assert that Non-U.S.&nbsp;Preferred Holders would be subject to U.S.&nbsp;federal income and withholding tax on their share of our company's ordinary income from sources within
the United&nbsp;States, even if distributions on the Series&nbsp;1 Preferred Units are treated as guaranteed payments. If, contrary to expectation, distributions on the Series&nbsp;1 Preferred
Units are not treated as guaranteed payments, then a Non-U.S.&nbsp;Preferred Holder might be subject to a withholding tax of up to 30% on the gross amount of certain U.S.-source income of our
company, including dividends and certain interest income, which is not effectively connected with a U.S.&nbsp;trade or&nbsp;business. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;text-align:justify"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based
on our organizational structure, as well as our expected income and assets, the BPY General Partner currently believes that our company is unlikely to earn income treated as
effectively connected with a U.S.&nbsp;trade or business, including effectively connected income attributable to the sale of a "United&nbsp;States real property </FONT></P>

expectation, our company were deemed to be engaged in a U.S.&nbsp;trade or business, then a Non-U.S.&nbsp;Preferred Holder of Series&nbsp;1 Preferred Units generally would be required to
file&nbsp;a U.S.&nbsp;federal income tax return, and distributions to such holder might be treated as "effectively connected income" (which would subject such holder to U.S.&nbsp;net income
taxation and possibly "branch profits" tax in the case of a corporate Non-U.S.&nbsp;Preferred Holder) and might be subject to withholding tax imposed at the highest effective tax rate applicable to
such Non-U.S.&nbsp;Preferred Holder. If our company were engaged in a U.S.&nbsp;trade or business, then gain or loss from the sale of Series&nbsp;1 Preferred Units by a Non-U.S.&nbsp;Preferred
Holder generally would be treated as effectively connected with such trade or business to the extent that such Non-U.S.&nbsp;Preferred Holder would have had effectively connected gain or loss had
our company sold all of its assets at their fair market value as of the date of such sale. In such case, any such effectively connected gain generally would be taxable at regular U.S.&nbsp;federal
income tax rates, and the amount realized from such sale generally would be subject to a 10% U.S.&nbsp;federal withholding&nbsp;tax. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;text-align:justify"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Investors

<P style="font-family:times;text-align:justify"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Series&nbsp;1 Preferred Units offered hereby are a new series of preferred units of our company. Upon completion of this

involuntary, the holders of our LP&nbsp;Units, Series&nbsp;1 Preferred Units, general partner interest and other partnership securities (if&nbsp;any) are entitled to receive distributions of our
assets as provided in our Partnership Agreement, after we have satisfied or made provision for our outstanding indebtedness and other obligations and after payment to the holders of any class or

appear on our unit transfer books maintained by the Registrar and Transfer Agent at the address of such holders shown therein. Such notice shall state: (i)&nbsp;the redemption date, (ii)&nbsp;the
number of Series&nbsp;1 Preferred Units to be redeemed and, if less than all outstanding Series&nbsp;1 Preferred Units are to be redeemed, the number (and, in the case of Series&nbsp;1 Preferred

Series&nbsp;1 Preferred Units will be redeemed by such method of selection as the Securities Depositary shall determine, pro&nbsp;rata or by lot, with adjustments to avoid redemption of fractional
units. So long as all Series&nbsp;1 Preferred Units are held of record by the nominee of the Securities Depositary, we will give notice, or cause notice to be given, to the Securities Depositary of
the number of Series&nbsp;1 Preferred Units to be redeemed, and the Securities Depositary will determine the number of Series&nbsp;1 Preferred Units to be redeemed from the account of each of its
participants holding such Series&nbsp;1 Preferred Units in its participant account. Thereafter, each participant will select the number of Series&nbsp;1 Preferred Units to be redeemed from each
beneficial owner for whom it acts (including the participant, to the extent it holds Series&nbsp;1 Preferred Units for its own account). A participant may determine to redeem Series&nbsp;1
Preferred Units from some beneficial owners (including the participant itself) without redeeming Series&nbsp;1 Preferred Units from the accounts of other beneficial owners. Any Series&nbsp;1

<P style="font-family:times;text-align:justify"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So long as the Series&nbsp;1 Preferred Units are held of record by the nominee of the Securities Depositary, the redemption price will be paid by the Paying
Agent to the Securities Depositary on the redemption date. The Securities Depositary's normal procedures provide for it to distribute the amount of the redemption price in same-day funds to its
participants who, in turn, are expected to distribute such funds to the persons for whom they are acting as&nbsp;agent. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;text-align:justify"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If
we give or cause to be given a notice of redemption, then we will deposit with the Paying Agent funds sufficient to redeem the Series&nbsp;1 Preferred Units as to which notice has
been given by 10:00&nbsp;a.m., New&nbsp;York City time, on the date fixed for redemption, and will give the Paying Agent irrevocable instructions and authority to pay the redemption price to the
holder or holders thereof upon surrender or deemed surrender (which will occur automatically if the certificate representing such Series&nbsp;1 Preferred Units is issued in the name of the
Securities Depositary or its nominee) of the certificates therefor. If a notice of redemption shall have been given, then from and after the date fixed for redemption, unless we default in providing
funds sufficient for such redemption at the time and place specified for payment pursuant to the notice, all distributions on such Series&nbsp;1 Preferred Units will cease to accumulate and all
rights of holders of such Series&nbsp;1 Preferred Units as limited partners will cease (and&nbsp;such Series&nbsp;1 Preferred Units shall not thereafter be transferred on the books of the
Registrar and Transfer Agent or be deemed outstanding for any purpose
whatsoever), except the right to receive the redemption price, including an amount equal to accumulated and unpaid distributions to the date fixed for redemption, whether or not declared. The holders
of Series&nbsp;1 Preferred Units will have no claim to the interest income, if any, earned on such funds deposited with the Paying Agent. Any funds deposited with the Paying Agent hereunder by us
for any reason, including, but not limited to, redemption of Series&nbsp;1 Preferred Units, that remain unclaimed or unpaid after one year after the applicable redemption date or other payment date,
shall be, to the extent permitted by law, repaid to us upon our written request, after which repayment the holders of the Series&nbsp;1 Preferred Units entitled to such redemption or other payment
shall have recourse only to&nbsp;us. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;text-align:justify"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If
only a portion of the Series&nbsp;1 Preferred Units represented by a certificate has been called for redemption, upon surrender of the certificate to the Paying Agent (which will
occur automatically if the certificate representing such Series&nbsp;1 Preferred Units is registered in the name of the Securities Depositary or its nominee), we will issue and the Paying Agent will
deliver to the holder of such Series&nbsp;1 Preferred Units a new certificate (or&nbsp;adjust the applicable book-entry account) representing the number of Series&nbsp;1 Preferred Units
represented by the surrendered certificate that have not been called for&nbsp;redemption. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;text-align:justify"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding
any notice of redemption, there will be no redemption of any Series&nbsp;1 Preferred Units called for redemption until funds sufficient to pay the full redemption price
of such Series&nbsp;1 Preferred Units, including all accumulated and unpaid distributions to, but excluding, the date of redemption, whether or not declared, have been deposited by us with the
Paying&nbsp;Agent. </FONT></P>

may from time to time purchase Series&nbsp;1 Preferred Units, including by tender offer, open market purchases, negotiated transactions or otherwise, subject to compliance with all

<P style="font-family:times;text-align:justify"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding
the foregoing, in the event that full cumulative distributions on the Series&nbsp;1 Preferred Units and any Parity Securities have not been paid or declared and set

made on the same&nbsp;relative terms to all holders of Series&nbsp;1 Preferred Units and any Parity Securities. As long as any Series&nbsp;1 Preferred Units are outstanding, except out of the
net cash proceeds of a substantially concurrent issue of Junior Securities, we may not redeem, repurchase or otherwise acquire any partnership interests in our company (other than a Class&nbsp;A
Preferred Unit) or any other series of Junior Securities unless full cumulative distributions on the Series&nbsp;1 Preferred Units and any Parity Securities for all prior and the then-ending

<P style="font-family:times;text-align:justify"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bermuda Limited Partnership Act of 1883, under which our company has been established, does not impose statutory fiduciary duties
on a general partner of a limited partnership in the same manner that certain corporate statutes, such as the Delaware Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act, impose fiduciary duties on directors of
a corporation. In general, under applicable Bermudian legislation, a general partner has a duty to act in good faith and subject to any express provisions of the partnership agreement to the contrary,
to act in the interests of the limited partnership. A general partner also has certain limited duties to its limited partners, such as the duty to render accounts, account for private profits and not
compete with the partnership in business. In addition, Bermudian common law recognizes that a general partner owes a duty of utmost good faith to its limited partners. However, to the extent that
the BPY General Partner owes any such fiduciary duties to our company and holders of partnership interests in our company, these duties have been modified pursuant to our Partnership Agreement as a
matter of contract law, with the exception of the duty of our general partner to act in good faith, which cannot be&nbsp;modified. </FONT></P>

Units offered hereby will continue to be represented by a single certificate registered in the name of the Securities Depositary or its nominee, and no holder of the Series&nbsp;1 Preferred Units
offered hereby will be entitled to receive a certificate evidencing such Series&nbsp;1 Preferred Units unless otherwise required by law or the Securities Depositary gives notice of its intention to
resign or is no longer eligible to act as such and we have not selected a substitute Securities Depositary within 60&nbsp;calendar days thereafter. Payments and communications made by us to holders
of the Series&nbsp;1 Preferred Units will be duly made by making payments to, and communicating with, the Securities Depositary. Accordingly, unless certificates are available to holders of
the&nbsp;Series 1&nbsp;Preferred Units, each purchaser of Series&nbsp;1 Preferred Units must rely on (i)&nbsp;the procedures of the Securities Depositary and its participants to receive
distributions, any redemption price, liquidation preference and notices, and to direct the exercise of any voting rights, with respect to such Series&nbsp;1 Preferred Units and (ii)&nbsp;the
records of the Securities Depositary and its participants to evidence its ownership of such Series&nbsp;1 Preferred Units. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;text-align:justify"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each of our company and the Property Partnership has made a protective election to be classified as a partnership for
U.S.&nbsp;federal tax purposes. An entity that is treated as a partnership for U.S.&nbsp;federal tax purposes generally incurs no U.S.&nbsp;federal income tax liability. Instead, each partner
generally is required to take into account its allocable share of items of income, gain, loss, or deduction of the partnership in computing its U.S.&nbsp;federal income tax liability, regardless of
whether cash distributions are made. However, we expect to treat holders of the Series&nbsp;1 Preferred Units as generally not sharing in allocations of our income, gain, loss, or deduction.
Instead, we will treat distributions on the Series&nbsp;1 Preferred Units as guaranteed payments for the use of capital. Please see "—&nbsp;Consequences to U.S.&nbsp;Preferred

<P style="font-family:times;text-align:justify"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An
entity that would otherwise be classified as a partnership for U.S.&nbsp;federal income tax purposes may nonetheless be taxable as a corporation if it is a "publicly traded
partnership," unless an exception applies. Our company is publicly traded. However, an exception, referred to as the "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B>Qualifying Income Exception</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>,"
exists with respect to a publicly traded partnership if (i)&nbsp;at least 90% of such partnership's gross income for
every taxable year consists of "qualifying income" and (ii)&nbsp;the partnership would not be required to register under the Investment Company Act of 1940 if it were a U.S.&nbsp;corporation.
Qualifying income includes certain interest income, dividends, real property rents, gains from the sale or other disposition of real property, and any gain from the sale or disposition of a capital
asset or other property held for the production of income that otherwise constitutes qualifying income. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;text-align:justify"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
BPY General Partner intends to manage the affairs of our company and the Property Partnership so that our company will meet the Qualifying Income Exception in each taxable year.
Based upon factual statements and representations made by the&nbsp;BPY General Partner, Torys&nbsp;LLP is of the opinion that at least 90% of our company's and the Property Partnership's gross
income has been, and currently is, of a type that constitutes qualifying income. However, the portion of our company's and the Property Partnership's income that is qualifying income may change from
time to time, and there can be no assurance that at least 90% of our company's and the Property Partnership's gross income in any year will constitute qualifying income. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;text-align:justify"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No
ruling has been or will be sought from the IRS, and the IRS has made no determination as to our company's or the Property Partnership's status for U.S.&nbsp;federal income tax
purposes or whether our company's or the Property Partnership's operations generate "qualifying income" under Section&nbsp;7704 of the U.S.&nbsp;Internal Revenue Code. It is the opinion of
Torys&nbsp;LLP that, based upon the U.S.&nbsp;Internal Revenue Code, U.S.&nbsp;Treasury Regulations, published revenue rulings, and court decisions, and the factual statements and
representations made by the BPY General Partner, as of the date hereof, each of our company and the Property Partnership will be classified as a partnership and not as an association or publicly
traded partnership taxable as a corporation for United&nbsp;States federal income tax purposes. An opinion of counsel with respect to an issue represents counsel's best judgment as to the outcome on
the merits with respect to such issue, is not binding on the IRS or the courts, and provides no assurance that the IRS will not assert a contrary position with respect to such issue or that a court
will not sustain such a position if asserted by the&nbsp;IRS. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;text-align:justify"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
rendering its opinions, Torys&nbsp;LLP has relied on numerous factual representations made by the BPY General Partner, including but not limited to
the&nbsp;following:</FONT></P>

<DL compact>
<DT style='font-family:times;margin-bottom:-11pt;'><FONT SIZE=2>•</FONT></DT><DD style="font-family:times;text-align:justify"><FONT SIZE=2>Neither our company nor the Property Partnership has elected to be classified as a corporation for United&nbsp;States
federal tax purposes, and neither our company nor the Property Partnership has any plan or intention to elect to be so&nbsp;classified. </FONT><FONT SIZE=2>
<BR><BR></FONT></DD><DT style='font-family:times;margin-bottom:-11pt;'><FONT SIZE=2>•</FONT></DT><DD style="font-family:times;text-align:justify"><FONT SIZE=2>For each of our company's and the Property Partnership's taxable years, more than 90% of each entity's gross income has
consisted of income of a type that Torys&nbsp;LLP is of the opinion constitutes "qualifying income" within the meaning of Section&nbsp;7704(d) of the U.S.&nbsp;Internal Revenue&nbsp;Code. </FONT></DD></DL>
</UL>

<P style="font-family:times;text-align:justify"><FONT SIZE=2>Based
on the foregoing, the BPY General Partner believes that our company will be treated as a partnership and not as a corporation for U.S.&nbsp;federal income tax&nbsp;purposes. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;text-align:justify"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If
our company fails to meet the Qualifying Income Exception, other than a failure which is determined by the IRS to be inadvertent and which is cured within a reasonable time after
discovery, or if our company is required to register under the Investment Company Act of 1940, our company will be treated as if it had transferred all of its assets, subject to liabilities, to a
newly formed corporation, on the first day of the year in which our company fails to meet the Qualifying Income Exception, in return for stock in such corporation, and then distributed the stock to
holders of partnership interests in our company in liquidation. This deemed contribution and liquidation could result in the recognition of gain (but&nbsp;not loss) to U.S.&nbsp;Preferred Holders.
Thereafter, our company would be treated as a corporation for U.S.&nbsp;federal income tax&nbsp;purposes. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;text-align:justify"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If
our company were treated as a corporation in any taxable year, either as a result of a failure to meet the Qualifying Income Exception or otherwise, our company's items of income,
gain, loss, deduction, or credit would be reflected only on our company's tax return rather than being passed through to holders of partnership interests in our company, and our company would be
subject to U.S.&nbsp;corporate income tax and potentially branch profits tax with respect to its income, if any, effectively connected with a U.S.&nbsp;trade or business. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;text-align:justify"><FONT SIZE=2>Moreover,
under certain circumstances, our company might be classified as a PFIC for U.S.&nbsp;federal income tax purposes, and a U.S.&nbsp;Preferred Holder would be subject to the rules
applicable to PFICs. See "—&nbsp;Consequences to U.S.&nbsp;Holders&nbsp;—&nbsp;Passive Foreign Investment Companies" in Item&nbsp;10.E
"Taxation&nbsp;—&nbsp;U.S.&nbsp;Tax Considerations" in our most recent Annual Report on Form&nbsp;20-F. Subject to the PFIC rules, distributions made to
U.S.&nbsp;Preferred Holders would be treated as taxable dividend income to the extent of our company's current or accumulated earnings and profits. Any distribution in excess of current and
accumulated earnings and profits would first be treated as a tax-free return of capital to the extent of a U.S.&nbsp;Preferred Holder's adjusted tax basis in its Series&nbsp;1 Preferred Units
(reducing that basis accordingly). Thereafter, to the extent such distribution were to exceed a U.S.&nbsp;Preferred Holder's adjusted tax basis in its Series&nbsp;1 Preferred Units, the
distribution would be treated as gain from the sale or exchange of such Series&nbsp;1 Preferred Units. In addition, dividends, interest and certain other passive income received by our company with
respect to U.S.&nbsp;investments generally would be subject to U.S.&nbsp;withholding tax at a rate of 30%, and U.S.&nbsp;Preferred Holders would not be allowed a tax credit with respect to any
such tax withheld. The "portfolio interest" exemption would not apply to certain interest income of our company. Depending on the circumstances, additional adverse U.S.&nbsp;federal income tax
consequences could result under the anti-inversion rules described in Section&nbsp;7874 of the U.S.&nbsp;Internal Revenue Code, the U.S.&nbsp;Treasury Regulations under Section&nbsp;385 of the
U.S.&nbsp;Internal Revenue Code, or other provisions of the U.S.&nbsp;Internal Revenue Code, as implemented by the U.S.&nbsp;Treasury Regulations and IRS administrative guidance. Based on the
foregoing consequences, the treatment of our company as a corporation could materially reduce a holder's after-tax return and therefore could result in a substantial reduction of the value of the
partnership interests in our company. If the Property Partnership were to be treated as a corporation for U.S.&nbsp;federal income tax purposes, consequences similar to those described above would
apply. Based on the foregoing consequences, the treatment of our company as a corporation could materially reduce a holder's after-tax return and therefore could result in a substantial reduction of
the value of the Series&nbsp;1 Preferred Units. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;text-align:justify"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
discussion below is based on Torys&nbsp;LLP's opinion that each of our company and the Property Partnership will be classified as a partnership for U.S.&nbsp;federal income
tax&nbsp;purposes. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;text-align:justify"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tax treatment of the Series&nbsp;1 Preferred Units is uncertain. We will treat holders of Series&nbsp;1 Preferred Units as
partners entitled to a guaranteed payment for the use of capital on their Series&nbsp;1 Preferred Units, although the IRS may disagree with this treatment. If the Series&nbsp;1 Preferred Units are
not partnership interests, they would likely constitute indebtedness for U.S.&nbsp;federal income tax purposes, and distributions on the Series&nbsp;1 Preferred Units would constitute ordinary
interest income. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;text-align:justify"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
remainder of this discussion assumes that the Series&nbsp;1 Preferred Units are partnership interests for U.S.&nbsp;federal income tax purposes. Holders are urged to consult

<P style="font-family:times;text-align:justify"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tax treatment of distributions on the Series&nbsp;1 Preferred Units is uncertain. As noted above, we will treat distributions on
the Series&nbsp;1 Preferred Units as guaranteed payments for the use of capital that generally will be taxable to U.S.&nbsp;Preferred Holders as ordinary income and will be deductible by us.
Although a U.S.&nbsp;Preferred Holder will recognize taxable income from the accrual of such a guaranteed payment (even in the absence of a contemporaneous cash distribution), our company
anticipates accruing and making the guaranteed payment distributions quarterly. U.S.&nbsp;Preferred Holders generally are not expected to share in our company's items of income, gain, loss, or
deduction, nor will we allocate any share of the partnership's nonrecourse liabilities, if any, to such&nbsp;holders. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;text-align:justify"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If
the distributions to the Series&nbsp;1 Preferred Units are not respected as guaranteed payments for the use of capital, U.S.&nbsp;Preferred Holders may be treated as receiving an
allocable share of gross income from our company equal to their cash distributions, to the extent the partnership has sufficient gross income to make such allocations of gross income. In the event
there is not sufficient gross income to match such distributions, the distributions on the Series&nbsp;1 Preferred Units would reduce the capital accounts of the holders of the Series&nbsp;1 </FONT></P>

Preferred Units will be allocated any share of our liabilities. The IRS has ruled that a partner who acquires interests in a partnership in separate transactions must combine those interests and
maintain a single adjusted tax basis for all of those interests. If you own LP&nbsp;Units and Series&nbsp;1 Preferred Units, please consult your own tax adviser regarding the consequences of a

<P style="font-family:times;text-align:justify"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In general, the receipt by a U.S.&nbsp;Preferred Holder of amounts in redemption of Series&nbsp;1 Preferred Units will result in
the recognition of taxable gain to the holder for U.S.&nbsp;federal income tax purposes only if and to the extent the amount of redemption proceeds received exceeds such holder's tax basis in all
the partnership interests in our company (including LP&nbsp;Units) held by such holder immediately before the redemption. Any such redemption of Series&nbsp;1 Preferred Units would result in the
recognition of taxable loss to a U.S.&nbsp;Preferred Holder for U.S.&nbsp;federal income tax purposes only if the holder does not hold any other partnership interests in our company (including
LP&nbsp;Units) immediately after the redemption and the holder's tax basis in the redeemed Series&nbsp;1 Preferred Units exceeds the amounts received by the holder in redemption thereof. Any
taxable gain or loss recognized under the foregoing&nbsp;rules would be treated in the same manner as taxable gain or loss recognized on a sale of Series&nbsp;1 Preferred Units as described above
in "—&nbsp;Recognition of Gain or Loss from Disposition." </FONT></P>

(i)&nbsp;the excess of such U.S.&nbsp;Preferred Holders' "modified adjusted gross income" (or&nbsp;"adjusted gross income" in the case of estates and trusts) over certain thresholds and
(ii)&nbsp;such U.S.&nbsp;Preferred Holders' "net investment income" (or&nbsp;"undistributed net investment income" in the case of estates and trusts). Net investment income generally includes
guaranteed payments and gain realized by a U.S.&nbsp;Preferred Holder from a sale of Series&nbsp;1 Preferred Units. U.S.&nbsp;Preferred Holders should consult their own tax advisers regarding
the implications of the 3.8% Medicare tax for the ownership and disposition of our Series&nbsp;1 Preferred Units. </FONT></P>

beginning after December&nbsp;31, 2017, and before January&nbsp;1, 2026, non-corporate U.S.&nbsp;taxpayers who have domestic "qualified business income" from a partnership generally are, subject
to limitations, entitled to a deduction equal to 20% of such qualified business income. The 20% deduction is also allowed for "qualified publicly traded partnership income" and "qualified REIT
dividends." However, we generally do not expect the 20% deduction to be available with respect to income or gain recognized with respect to Series&nbsp;1 Preferred Units. U.S.&nbsp;Preferred

on our organizational structure, as well as our company's expected income and assets, the BPY General Partner currently believes that one or more of our existing Holding Entities
and operating entities are likely to be classified as PFICs. In general, subject to the discussion in the following paragraph, if a U.S.&nbsp;person owns a partnership interest in our company, then
any gain realized on the disposition of stock of a PFIC owned by such U.S.&nbsp;person indirectly through our company (including upon the disposition of such U.S.&nbsp;person's partnership
interest), as well as income realized on certain "excess distributions" by such PFIC, would be treated as though realized ratably over the shorter of such U.S.&nbsp;person's holding period of the
partnership interest in our company or our company's holding period for the PFIC, subject to certain elections. Such gain or income generally would be taxable as ordinary income. In addition, an
interest charge would apply, based on the tax deemed deferred from prior&nbsp;years. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;text-align:justify"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding
the general PFIC rules described above, based on our treatment of distributions on our Series&nbsp;1 Preferred Units as guaranteed payments for the use of capital, we
intend to take the position that the PFIC rules generally do not apply to U.S.&nbsp;Preferred Holders whose indirect interest in a PFIC arises solely by reason of owning our Series&nbsp;1
Preferred Units. In such case, gain on the disposition of stock of such a PFIC or income realized on excess distributions by such a PFIC should not be taxable to such U.S.&nbsp;Preferred Holders
under the PFIC rules. Consistent with our position, we do not anticipate allocating to a U.S.&nbsp;Preferred Holder any ordinary earnings or net capital gain attributable to any subsidiary PFIC with
respect to which we have made a "qualified electing fund" election ("</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B>QEF Election</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>"), if such U.S.&nbsp;Preferred Holder's interest in such PFIC arises

<P style="font-family:times;text-align:justify"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However,
the treatment of preferred partnership interests under the PFIC rules is uncertain. There can be no assurance that the IRS or a court will not treat a U.S.&nbsp;Preferred
Holder as subject to the PFIC rules that apply to U.S.&nbsp;persons holding partnership interests in our company generally. In such case, an investment by a U.S.&nbsp;Preferred Holder in our
Series&nbsp;1 Preferred Units may produce taxable income that is not related to distributions on such units, such as income realized on excess distributions by a PFIC&nbsp;or gain from the
disposition of stock of a PFIC. Such U.S.&nbsp;Preferred Holder may be required to take such income into account in determining such holder's gross income subject to tax. With respect to gain
realized upon the sale of and excess distributions from a PFIC for which a QEF Election for current inclusions is not made, such income would be taxable at ordinary income rates and subject to an
additional tax equivalent to an interest charge on the deferral of income inclusions from the PFIC. Other adverse PFIC consequences generally applicable to U.S.&nbsp;holders of partnership interests
in our company may also apply, as described in more detail in "—&nbsp;Consequences to U.S.&nbsp;Holders&nbsp;—&nbsp;Passive Foreign Investment

In general, employee benefit plans and most other organizations exempt from federal income tax, including individual retirement accounts and other retirement plans, are subject to U.S.&nbsp;federal
income tax on UBTI. We will treat distributions on the Series&nbsp;1 Preferred Units as guaranteed payments for the use of capital. Assuming we do not have income attributable to debt-financed
property, the Series&nbsp;1 Preferred Units are not treated as debt-financed by the tax-exempt holder thereof, and we are not engaged in a trade or business, then we generally do not expect
distributions on, or gain from the disposition of, the Series&nbsp;1 Preferred Units to be treated as UBTI. However, we are not prohibited from financing the acquisition of property with debt, and
the treatment of guaranteed payments for the use of capital to tax-exempt
organizations is not certain. Depending on the circumstances, such payments, or gain from the disposition of Series&nbsp;1 Preferred Units, may be treated as UBTI for U.S.&nbsp;federal income tax
purposes, and Torys&nbsp;LLP expresses no opinion with respect to whether distributions on the Series&nbsp;1 Preferred Units or gain from the disposition of Series&nbsp;1 Preferred Units

accurately or timely determine the tax status of our holders for purposes of determining whether U.S.&nbsp;withholding applies to payments made by our company to some or all of our holders. In such
a case, payments made by our company to U.S.&nbsp;Preferred Holders might be subject to U.S.&nbsp;"backup" withholding at the applicable rate or other U.S.&nbsp;withholding taxes. You would be
able to treat as a credit your allocable share of any U.S.&nbsp;withholding taxes paid in the taxable year in which such withholding taxes were paid and, as a result, you might be entitled to a
refund of such taxes from the IRS. In the event you transfer or otherwise dispose of some or all of your Series&nbsp;1 Preferred Units, special rules might apply for purposes of determining whether
you or the transferee of such units were subject to U.S.&nbsp;withholding taxes in respect of income allocable to, or distributions made on account of, such units or entitled to refunds of any such
taxes withheld. See "—&nbsp;Administrative Matters&nbsp;—&nbsp;Certain Effects of a Transfer of Units" in Item&nbsp;10.E
"Taxation&nbsp;—&nbsp;U.S.&nbsp;Tax Considerations" in our most recent Annual Report on Form&nbsp;20-F. You should consult your own tax adviser regarding the treatment

<P style="font-family:times;text-align:justify"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tax treatment of distributions on the Series&nbsp;1 Preferred Units to Non-U.S.&nbsp;Preferred Holders is uncertain. For
U.S.&nbsp;federal income tax purposes, we will treat distributions on the Series&nbsp;1 Preferred Units as guaranteed payments for the use of capital made from sources outside the
United&nbsp;States. We generally do not expect to withhold U.S.&nbsp;federal income tax on such guaranteed payments, provided that we are not engaged in a trade or business within the
United&nbsp;States. Assuming that the distributions qualify as&nbsp;guaranteed payments, Non-U.S.&nbsp;Preferred Holders generally are not expected to share in our company's items of income,
gain, loss, or deduction for U.S.&nbsp;federal income tax purposes. However, the tax treatment of guaranteed payments for source and withholding tax purposes is uncertain, and the IRS may disagree
with this treatment. As a result, it is possible that the IRS could assert that Non-U.S.&nbsp;Preferred Holders would be subject to U.S.&nbsp;federal income and withholding tax on their share of
our company's ordinary income from sources within the United&nbsp;States, even if distributions on the Series&nbsp;1 Preferred Units are treated as guaranteed payments. </FONT></P>

in a U.S.&nbsp;trade or business. As a result, such holder may be subject to a withholding tax of 30% on the gross amount of certain U.S.-source income of our company which is not
effectively connected with a U.S.&nbsp;trade or business. Income subjected to such a flat tax rate is income of a fixed or determinable annual or periodic nature, including dividends and certain
interest income. Such withholding tax may be reduced or eliminated with respect to certain types of income under an applicable income tax treaty between the United&nbsp;States and a

<P style="font-family:times;text-align:justify"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based
on our organizational structure, as well as our company's expected income and assets, the BPY General Partner currently believes that our company is unlikely to earn income treated
as effectively connected with a U.S.&nbsp;trade or business, including effectively connected income attributable to the sale of a "United&nbsp;States real property interest," as defined in the
U.S.&nbsp;Internal Revenue Code. Specifically, our company intends not to make an investment, whether directly or through an entity which would be treated as a partnership for U.S.&nbsp;federal
income tax purposes, if the BPY General Partner believes at the time of such investment that such investment would generate income treated as effectively connected with a U.S.&nbsp;trade or
business. If, as anticipated, our company is not treated as engaged in a U.S.&nbsp;trade or business or as deriving income which is treated as effectively connected with a U.S.&nbsp;trade or
business, and provided that a Non-U.S.&nbsp;Preferred Holder is not itself engaged in a U.S.&nbsp;trade or business, then such Non-U.S.&nbsp;Preferred Holder generally will not be subject to
U.S.&nbsp;federal tax return filing requirements solely as a result of owning the Series&nbsp;1 Preferred Units and generally will not be subject to U.S.&nbsp;federal net income tax on
distributions on such Series&nbsp;1 Preferred Units. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;text-align:justify"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However,
there can be no assurance that the law will not change or that the IRS will not deem our company to be engaged in a U.S.&nbsp;trade or business. If, contrary to the BPY
General Partner's expectations, our company is treated as engaged in a U.S.&nbsp;trade or business, then a Non-U.S.&nbsp;Preferred Holder generally would be required to file&nbsp;a
U.S.&nbsp;federal income tax return, even if no effectively connected income were allocable to it. In addition, distributions to such Non-U.S.&nbsp;Preferred Holder might be treated as
"effectively connected income" (which would subject such holder to U.S.&nbsp;net income taxation) and might be subject to withholding tax imposed at the highest effective tax rate applicable to such
Non-U.S.&nbsp;Preferred Holder. If the amount of withholding were to exceed the amount of U.S.&nbsp;federal income tax actually due, such Non-U.S.&nbsp;Preferred Holder might be required to
file&nbsp;a U.S.&nbsp;federal income tax return in order to seek a refund of such excess. A corporate Non-U.S.&nbsp;Preferred Holder might also be subject to branch profits tax at a rate of 30%,
or at a lower treaty rate, if applicable. Guaranteed payments paid or accrued within the partnership's taxable year might be included as income to Non-U.S.&nbsp;Preferred Holders whether or not a
distribution of such payments had actually been made. If, contrary to expectation, our company were treated as engaged in a U.S.&nbsp;trade or business, then gain or loss from the sale of
Series&nbsp;1 Preferred Units by a Non-U.S.&nbsp;Preferred Holder generally would be treated as effectively connected with such trade or business to the extent that such Non-U.S.&nbsp;Preferred
Holder would have had effectively connected gain or loss had our company sold all of its assets at their fair market value as of the date of such sale. In such case, any such effectively connected
gain generally would be taxable at the regular graduated U.S.&nbsp;federal income tax rates, and the amount realized from such sale generally would be subject to a 10% U.S.&nbsp;federal
withholding tax. The 10% U.S.&nbsp;federal withholding tax obligation temporarily is suspended with respect to the disposition of an interest in a publicly traded partnership (as&nbsp;defined for
tax purposes) until regulations or other guidance has been made final.
Non-U.S.&nbsp;Preferred Holders should consult their own tax advisers regarding the consequences of our company being engaged in a trade or business within the United&nbsp;States. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;text-align:justify"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assuming
that our company is not engaged in a U.S.&nbsp;trade or business (as&nbsp;discussed above), a Non-U.S.&nbsp;Preferred Holder generally is not expected to be subject to
U.S.&nbsp;federal income tax on gain or loss realized upon the sale or other disposition, including redemption, of Series&nbsp;1 Preferred Units. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;text-align:justify"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Special
rules may apply to any Non-U.S.&nbsp;Preferred Holder subject to specialized treatment, including, without limitation, any Non-U.S.&nbsp;Preferred Holder (i)&nbsp;that has
an office or fixed place of business in the United&nbsp;States; (ii)&nbsp;that is present in the United&nbsp;States for 183&nbsp;days or more in a taxable year; or (iii)&nbsp;that is

with its U.S.&nbsp;business, (c)&nbsp;a PFIC, (d)&nbsp;a CFC, or (e)&nbsp;a corporation that accumulates earnings to avoid U.S.&nbsp;federal income tax. You should consult your own tax

<P style="font-family:times;text-align:justify"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on our expected method of operation and the ownership of our operating entities indirectly through corporate Holding Entities, we
do not expect any holder of Series&nbsp;1 Preferred Units, solely as a result of owning such units, to be subject to any additional income taxes imposed on a net basis or additional tax return
filing requirements in any jurisdiction in which we conduct activities or own property. However, our method of operation and current structure may change, and there can be no assurance that, solely as
a result of owning our Series&nbsp;1 Preferred Units, you will not be subject to certain taxes, including non-U.S., state and local income taxes, unincorporated business taxes and estate,
inheritance or intangible taxes imposed by the various jurisdictions in which we do business or own property now or in the future, even if you do not reside in any of these jurisdictions.
Consequently, you may also be required to file non-U.S., state and local income tax returns in some or all of these jurisdictions. Further, you may be subject to penalties for failure to comply with
these requirements. It is your responsibility to file all U.S.&nbsp;federal, state, local, and non-U.S.&nbsp;tax returns that may be required of&nbsp;you. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;text-align:justify"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Income
or gain from investments held by our company may be subject to withholding or other taxes in jurisdictions outside the United&nbsp;States, except to the extent an income tax
treaty applies. If you wish to claim the benefit of an applicable income tax treaty, you might be required to submit information to one or more of our company, an intermediary, or a tax authority in
such jurisdiction. You should consult your own tax adviser regarding the U.S.&nbsp;state, local, and non-U.S.&nbsp;tax consequences of an investment in our Series&nbsp;1 Preferred Units. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;text-align:justify"><FONT SIZE=2><B><I> Information Returns and Audit Procedures  </I></B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;text-align:justify"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to furnish to you, within 90&nbsp;days after the close of each calendar year,
U.S.&nbsp;tax information (including IRS Schedule&nbsp;K-1), which describes on a U.S.&nbsp;Dollar basis your share of our company's income, gain, loss, and deduction, if any, for our preceding
taxable year. However, providing this U.S.&nbsp;tax information to our holders will be subject to delay in the event of, among other reasons, the late receipt of any necessary tax information from
lower-tier entities. It is therefore possible that, in any taxable year, you will need to apply for an extension of time to file your own tax returns. In preparing this U.S.&nbsp;tax information, we
will use various accounting and reporting conventions to determine your share of income, gain, loss, and deduction. Some of these conventions have been mentioned in the preceding discussion or in
Item&nbsp;10.E "Taxation&nbsp;—&nbsp;U.S.&nbsp;Tax Consideration" in our most recent Annual Report on Form&nbsp;20-F for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2018. The
IRS may successfully contend that certain of these reporting conventions are impermissible, which could result in an adjustment to your income or loss. Due to administrative reporting limitations, and
notwithstanding the rules described above under "—&nbsp;Consequences to U.S.&nbsp;Preferred Holders&nbsp;—&nbsp;Basis of Units" requiring aggregation
of partnership interests purchased in separate transactions, you may receive two Schedules&nbsp;K-1 if you hold both LP&nbsp;Units and Series&nbsp;1 Preferred Units. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;text-align:justify"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our
company may be audited by the IRS. Adjustments resulting from an IRS audit could require you to adjust a prior year's tax liability and result in an audit of your own tax return. Any
audit of your own tax return could result in adjustments not related to our company's tax returns, as well as those related to our company's tax returns. For taxable years beginning after
December&nbsp;31, 2017, if the IRS makes an audit adjustment to our income tax returns, it may assess and collect any taxes (including penalties and interest) resulting from such audit adjustment
directly from our company instead of holders of LP&nbsp;Units or Series&nbsp;1 Preferred Units (as&nbsp;under prior law). We may be permitted to elect to have the BPY General Partner,
LP&nbsp;Unitholders, and Series&nbsp;1 Preferred Unitholders take such audit adjustment into account in accordance with their interests in us during the taxable year under audit. However, there
can be no assurance that we will choose to make such election or that it will be available in all circumstances. If we do not make the election, and we pay taxes, penalties, or interest as a result of
an audit adjustment, then cash available for distribution to holders of LP&nbsp;Units and Series&nbsp;1 Preferred Units might be substantially reduced. As a result, our current
LP&nbsp;Unitholders and potentially Series&nbsp;1 Preferred Unitholders might bear some or all of the cost of the tax liability resulting from such audit adjustment, even if our current
LP&nbsp;Unitholders and Series&nbsp;1
Preferred Unitholders did not own partnership interests in our company during the taxable year under audit. The foregoing considerations also apply with respect to our company's interest in the
Property Partnership. </FONT></P>

taxable years beginning on or before December&nbsp;31, 2017, the BPY General Partner will act as our company's "tax matters partner." As the tax matters partner, the BPY General
Partner will have the authority, subject to certain restrictions, to act on behalf of our company in connection with any administrative or judicial review of our company's items of income, gain, loss,
deduction, or credit. For taxable years beginning after December&nbsp;31, 2017, a "partnership representative" designated by our company will have the sole authority to act on behalf of our company
in connection with such administrative or judicial review. In particular, our partnership representative will have the sole authority to bind both former and current holders of our LP&nbsp;Units and
Series&nbsp;1 Preferred Units and to make certain elections on behalf of our company pursuant to the partnership audit&nbsp;rules. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;text-align:justify"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
application of the partnership audit rules to our company and to holders of LP&nbsp;Units or Series&nbsp;1 Preferred Units is uncertain and remains subject to
U.S.&nbsp;Treasury Regulations and IRS guidance yet to be made final. You should consult your own tax adviser regarding the implications of the partnership audit rules for an investment in

<P style="font-family:times;text-align:justify"><FONT SIZE=2><B><I> Tax Shelter Regulations and Related Reporting Requirements  </I></B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;text-align:justify"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we were to engage in a "reportable transaction," we (and&nbsp;possibly our Series&nbsp;1 Preferred Unitholders) would be
required to make a detailed disclosure of the transaction to the IRS in accordance with regulations governing tax shelters and other potentially tax-motivated transactions. A transaction may be a
reportable transaction based upon any of several factors, including the fact that it is a type of tax avoidance transaction publicly identified by the IRS as a "listed transaction" or "transaction of
interest," or that it produces certain kinds of losses exceeding certain thresholds. An investment in our company may be considered a "reportable transaction" if, for example, our company were to
recognize certain significant losses in the future. In certain circumstances, a holder of a partnership interest in our company who disposes of an interest in a transaction resulting in the
recognition by such holder of significant losses in excess of certain threshold amounts may be obligated to disclose its participation in such transaction. Certain of these rules are unclear, and the
scope of reportable transactions can change retroactively. Therefore, it is possible that the rules may apply to transactions other than significant loss transactions. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;text-align:justify"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover,
if we were to participate in a reportable transaction with a significant purpose to avoid or evade tax, or in any listed transaction, you might be subject to significant
accuracy related penalties with a broad scope, for those persons otherwise entitled to deduct interest on federal tax deficiencies, non-deductibility of interest on any resulting tax liability, and in
the case of a listed transaction, an extended statute of
limitations. We do not intend to participate in any reportable transaction with a significant purpose to avoid or evade tax, nor do we intend to participate in any listed transactions. However, no
assurance can be provided that the IRS will not assert that we have participated in such a&nbsp;transaction. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;text-align:justify"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You
should consult your own tax adviser concerning any possible disclosure obligation under the regulations governing tax shelters with respect to the disposition of our Series&nbsp;1
Preferred Units. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;text-align:justify"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our company uses the calendar year as its taxable year for U.S.&nbsp;federal income tax purposes. Under certain circumstances which
we currently believe are unlikely to apply, a taxable year other than the calendar year may be required for such&nbsp;purposes. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;text-align:justify"><FONT SIZE=2><B><I> Withholding and Backup Withholding  </I></B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;text-align:justify"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For each calendar year, we will report to you and to the IRS the amount of distributions that we pay, and the amount of tax
(if&nbsp;any) that we withhold on these distributions. The proper application to our company of the rules for withholding under Sections&nbsp;1441 through&nbsp;1446 of the U.S.&nbsp;Internal
Revenue Code (applicable to certain dividends, interest, and amounts treated as effectively connected with a U.S.&nbsp;trade or business, among other items) is unclear. Because the documentation we
receive may not properly reflect the identities of holders of our LP&nbsp;Units or Series&nbsp;1 Preferred Units at any particular time (in&nbsp;light of possible sales of our LP&nbsp;Units or
Series&nbsp;1 Preferred Units), we may over-withhold or under-withhold with respect to a particular holder. For example, we may impose withholding, remit such amount to the IRS and thus reduce the

paid to a holder. It may be the case, however, that the corresponding amount of our income was not properly allocable to such holder, and the appropriate amount of withholding should have
been less than the actual amount withheld. Such holder would be entitled to a credit against the holder's U.S.&nbsp;federal income tax liability for all withholding, including any such excess
withholding. However, if the withheld amount were to exceed the holder's U.S.&nbsp;federal income tax liability, the holder would need to apply for a refund to obtain the benefit of such excess
withholding. Similarly, we may fail to withhold on a distribution, and it may be the case that the corresponding income was properly allocable to a holder and that withholding should have been
imposed. In such case, we intend to pay the under-withheld amount to&nbsp;the IRS, and we may treat such under-withholding as an expense that will be borne indirectly by holders on a pro&nbsp;rata
basis (since we may be unable to allocate any such excess withholding tax cost to the relevant holder). </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;text-align:justify"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under
the backup withholding rules, you may be subject to backup withholding tax with respect to distributions paid unless: (i)&nbsp;you are an exempt recipient and demonstrate this
fact when required; or (ii)&nbsp;provide a taxpayer identification number, certify as to no loss of exemption from backup withholding tax, and otherwise comply with the applicable requirements of
the backup withholding tax rules. A U.S.&nbsp;Preferred Holder that is exempt should certify such status on a properly completed IRS Form&nbsp;W-9. A Non-U.S.&nbsp;Preferred Holder may qualify
as an exempt recipient by submitting a properly completed IRS Form&nbsp;W-8. Backup withholding is not an additional tax. The amount of any backup withholding from a payment to you will be allowed
as a credit against your U.S.&nbsp;federal income tax liability and may entitle you to a refund from the IRS, provided you supply the required information to the IRS in a timely&nbsp;manner. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;text-align:justify"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If
you do not timely provide our company, or the applicable nominee, broker, clearing agent, or other intermediary, with IRS Form&nbsp;W-9 or&nbsp;IRS Form&nbsp;W-8, as applicable,
or&nbsp;such form is not properly completed, then our company may become subject to U.S.&nbsp;backup withholding taxes in excess of what would have been imposed had our company or the applicable
intermediary received properly completed forms from all holders of partnership interests in our company. For administrative reasons, and in order to maintain the fungibility of units of our company,
such excess U.S.&nbsp;backup withholding taxes, and if necessary similar items, may be treated by our company as an expense that will be borne indirectly by holders of partnership interests in our
company on a pro&nbsp;rata basis (e.g.,&nbsp;since it may be impractical for us to allocate any such excess withholding tax cost to the holders that failed to timely provide the proper
U.S.&nbsp;tax&nbsp;forms). </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;text-align:justify"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FATCA imposes a 30% withholding tax on "withholdable payments" made to a "foreign financial institution" or a "non-financial foreign
entity," unless such financial institution or entity satisfies certain information reporting or other requirements. Withholdable payments include certain U.S.-source income, such as interest,
dividends, and other passive income. Recently proposed U.S.&nbsp;Treasury Regulations eliminate the requirement to withhold tax under FATCA on gross proceeds from the sale or disposition of property
that can produce U.S.-source interest or dividends. The IRS has announced that taxpayers are permitted to rely on the proposed regulations until final U.S.&nbsp;Treasury Regulations
are&nbsp;issued. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;text-align:justify"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
intend to comply with FATCA, so as to ensure that the 30% withholding tax does not apply to any withholdable payments received by our company, the Property Partnership, the Holding
Entities, or the operating entities. Nonetheless, the 30% withholding tax may apply to your allocable share of distributions attributable to withholdable payments, unless you properly certify your
FATCA status on IRS Form&nbsp;W-8 or&nbsp;IRS Form&nbsp;W-9 (or&nbsp;other applicable form) and satisfy any additional requirements under&nbsp;FATCA. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;text-align:justify"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
compliance with FATCA, information regarding certain holders' ownership of our Series&nbsp;1 Preferred Units may be reported to the IRS or to a non-U.S.&nbsp;governmental
authority. FATCA remains subject to modification by an applicable intergovernmental agreement between the United&nbsp;States and another country, such as the agreement in effect between the
United&nbsp;States and Bermuda for cooperation to facilitate the implementation of FATCA, or by future U.S.&nbsp;Treasury Regulations or guidance. You should consult your own tax adviser regarding
the consequences under FATCA of an investment in our Series&nbsp;1 Preferred Units. </FONT></P>

held for investment that has an issuer or counterparty other than a U.S.&nbsp;person, and any interest in a foreign entity. The failure to report information required under the current regulations

been advised by the underwriters that&nbsp;they intend to make a market in the Series&nbsp;1 Preferred Units pending any listing of the Series&nbsp;1 Preferred Units on Nasdaq, but they are not
obligated to do so and may discontinue market-making at any time without notice. We cannot assure that the Series&nbsp;1 Preferred Units will be approved for listing by Nasdaq, that an active
trading market on Nasdaq for the Series&nbsp;1 Preferred Units will develop or, even if it develops, will last. If an active trading market for the Series&nbsp;1 Preferred Units does not develop,
the market price and liquidity of the Series&nbsp;1 Preferred Units may be adversely affected. If an active trading market does develop on Nasdaq, the Series&nbsp;1 Preferred Units may trade at
prices lower than the offering price. The trading price of the Series&nbsp;1 Preferred Units would depend on many factors, including the trading price of our LP&nbsp;Units, prevailing interest
rates, the market for similar securities, general economic and financial market conditions, the credit ratings of the Series&nbsp;1 Preferred Units, our issuance of debt or other preferred

a greater number of units than they are required to purchase in the offering. "Covered" short sales are sales of Series&nbsp;1 Preferred Units in an amount up to the number of Series&nbsp;1
Preferred Units represented by the underwriters' option to purchase additional units. "Naked" short sales are sales of Series&nbsp;1 Preferred Units in an amount in excess of the number of
Series&nbsp;1 Preferred Units represented by the underwriters' option to purchase additional units. Covering transactions involve purchases of Series&nbsp;1 Preferred Units either pursuant to the
underwriters' option to purchase additional units or in the open market after the distribution has been completed to cover short positions. To close a naked short position, the underwriters must
purchase Series&nbsp;1 Preferred Units in the open market after the distribution has been completed. A naked short position is more likely to be created if the underwriters are concerned that there
may be downward pressure on the price of the Series&nbsp;1 Preferred Units in the open market after pricing that could adversely affect investors who purchase in the offering. To close a covered
short position, the underwriters must purchase Series&nbsp;1 Preferred Units in the open market after the distribution has been completed or must exercise the option to purchase additional units. In
determining the source of Series&nbsp;1 Preferred Units to close the covered short position, the underwriters will consider, among other things, the price of Series&nbsp;1 Preferred Units
available for purchase in the open market as compared to the price at which they may purchase Series&nbsp;1 Preferred Units through the option to purchase additional units. Stabilizing transactions

<P style="font-family:times;text-align:justify"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This prospectus and the documents incorporated by reference in this prospectus contain certain "forward-looking statements" and
"forward-looking information" within the meaning of applicable U.S. and Canadian securities laws. Forward-looking statements include statements that are predictive in nature, depend upon or refer to
future events or conditions, include statements regarding our operations, business, financial condition, expected financial results, performance, prospects, opportunities, priorities, targets, goals,
ongoing objectives, strategies and outlook, as well as the outlook for North American and international economies for the current fiscal year and subsequent periods, and include words such as
"expects", "anticipates", "plans", "believes", "estimates", "seeks", "intends", "targets", "projects", "forecasts", "likely", or negative versions thereof and other similar expressions, or future or
conditional verbs such as "may", "will", "should", "would" and&nbsp;"could". </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;text-align:justify"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although
we believe that our anticipated future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements and information are based upon reasonable
assumptions and expectations, the reader should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements and information because they involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors,
many of which are beyond our control, which may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from anticipated future
results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements and information. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;text-align:justify"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Factors
that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated or implied by forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to: risks incidental to the
ownership and operation of real estate properties including local real estate conditions; the impact or unanticipated impact of general economic, political and market factors in the countries in which
we do business; the ability to enter into new leases or renew leases on favorable terms; business competition; dependence on tenants' financial condition; the use of debt to finance our business; the
behavior of financial markets, including fluctuations in interest and foreign exchanges rates; uncertainties of real estate development or redevelopment; global equity and capital markets and the
availability of equity and debt financing and refinancing within these markets; risks relating to our insurance coverage; the possible impact of international conflicts and other developments
including terrorist acts; potential environmental liabilities; changes in tax laws and other tax related risks; dependence on management personnel; illiquidity of investments; the ability to complete
and effectively integrate acquisitions into existing operations and the ability to attain expected benefits therefrom; operational and reputational risks; catastrophic events, such as earthquakes and
hurricanes; and other risks and factors detailed from time to time in our documents filed with the securities regulators in Canada and the United&nbsp;States, as&nbsp;applicable. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;text-align:justify"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
caution that the foregoing list of important factors that may affect future results is not exhaustive. When relying on our forward-looking statements or information, investors and
others should carefully consider the foregoing factors and other uncertainties and potential events. The risk factors included in our Annual Report and&nbsp;in other documents incorporated by
reference could cause our actual results, performance, achievements, plans and strategies to vary from our forward-looking statements. In light of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, the
events described by our forward-looking statements and information might not occur. We qualify any and all of our forward-looking statements and information by these risk factors. Please keep this
cautionary note in mind as you read this prospectus and the documents incorporated by&nbsp;reference. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;text-align:justify"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Except
as required by law, we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements or information, whether written or oral, that may be as a result of new
information, future events or&nbsp;otherwise. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;text-align:justify"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our company is formed under the laws of Bermuda. A substantial portion of our company's assets may be located outside of Canada and the
United&nbsp;States and certain of the directors of the BPY General Partner, as well as certain of the experts named in this prospectus, may be residents of jurisdictions outside of Canada and the
United&nbsp;States. We have expressly submitted to the jurisdiction of certain state and federal courts in New&nbsp;York and of the Ontario courts and have appointed an attorney for service of
process in Ontario and in the United&nbsp;States. However, it may be difficult for investors to effect service within Ontario or elsewhere in Canada or the United&nbsp;States upon those directors
and experts who are not residents of Canada or the United&nbsp;States. Furthermore, it may be difficult to realize upon or enforce in Canada or the United&nbsp;States any judgment of a court of
Canada or the United&nbsp;States against us, the directors of the BPY General Partner, or the experts named in this prospectus since a substantial portion of our assets and the assets of such
persons may be located outside of Canada and the United&nbsp;States. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;text-align:justify"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
have been advised by counsel that there is no treaty in force between Canada and Bermuda or the United&nbsp;States and Bermuda providing for the reciprocal recognition and
enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters. As a result, whether a Canadian or U.S.&nbsp;judgment would be capable of being the subject of enforcement proceedings in Bermuda against
us, the directors of the BPY General Partner, or the experts named in this prospectus depends on whether the Canadian or U.S.&nbsp;court that entered the judgment is recognized by a Bermuda court as
having jurisdiction over us, the directors of the BPY General Partner, or the experts named in this prospectus, as determined by reference to Bermuda conflict of law rules. The courts of Bermuda would
issue a final and conclusive judgment in personam in respect of a judgment obtained in a Canadian or U.S.&nbsp;court pursuant to which a defined sum of money is payable (other than a sum of money
payable in respect of multiple damages, taxes or other charges of a like nature or in respect of a fine or other penalty) as long as (i)&nbsp;the Canadian or U.S.&nbsp;court had proper
jurisdiction over the parties subject to the Canadian or U.S.&nbsp;judgment according to Bermuda's conflicts of law principles; (ii)&nbsp;the Canadian or U.S.&nbsp;court did not contravene the
rules of natural justice of Bermuda; (iii)&nbsp;the Canadian or U.S.&nbsp;judgment was not obtained by fraud; (iv)&nbsp;the enforcement of the Canadian or U.S.&nbsp;judgment would not be
contrary to the public policy of Bermuda; and (v)&nbsp;there is due compliance with the applicable common law rules in Bermuda governing the enforcement of a foreign judgment. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;text-align:justify"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For
avoidance of doubt, in addition to and irrespective of jurisdictional issues, Bermuda courts will not enforce a provision of Canadian or U.S.&nbsp;federal securities laws that is
either penal in nature or contrary to public policy. It is the advice of our Bermuda counsel that an action brought pursuant to a public or penal law (including specified remedies under Canadian
securities law or U.S.&nbsp;federal securities law), the purpose of which </FONT></P>
