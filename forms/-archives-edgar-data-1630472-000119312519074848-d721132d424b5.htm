commercial mortgage loans and other commercial real estate-related debt instruments. While the commercial real estate debt markets are complex and continually evolving, we believe they offer significant opportunities to our stockholders for
attractive risk-adjusted returns over time, when approached with the institutional capabilities and expertise of our Manager, an affiliate of TPG, one of the world’s leading investment firms. Our objective is to provide attractive risk-adjusted
returns to our stockholders over time through cash distributions and capital appreciation. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We focus primarily on directly originating and

our investment strategy. We may also use a portion of the net proceeds for working capital and other general corporate purposes, which may include, among others, the repayment of outstanding indebtedness under our secured revolving repurchase

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In order for us to continue to qualify as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Internal Revenue Code”),
our shares of stock must be owned by 100 or more persons during at least 335 days of a taxable year of 12 months or during a proportionate part of a shorter taxable year. Also, not more than 50% of the value of the outstanding shares of our stock
may be owned, directly or indirectly, by five or fewer individuals (as defined in the Internal Revenue Code to include certain entities) during the last half of a taxable year. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our charter contains restrictions on the ownership and transfer of our stock. The relevant sections of our charter provide that, subject to
the exceptions described below, no person or entity may own, or be deemed to own, by virtue of certain constructive ownership provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, more than 9.8% in value or in number of shares, whichever is more restrictive, of
the outstanding shares of any class or series of our capital stock (which we refer to as the “ownership limit”). A person or entity that becomes subject to the ownership limit by virtue of a violative transfer that results in a transfer to
a trust, as described below, is referred to as a “prohibited owner” if, had the violative transfer or other event been effective, the person or entity would have been a beneficial or constructive owner or, if appropriate, a record owner of
shares of our capital stock in violation of the ownership limit or other restrictions. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The constructive ownership rules under the
Internal Revenue Code are complex and may cause shares of stock owned actually or constructively by a group of related individuals or entities to be owned constructively by one individual or entity. As a result, the acquisition of less than 9.8% in
value or in number of shares, whichever is more restrictive, of the outstanding shares of any class or series of our capital stock (or the acquisition of an interest in an entity that owns, actually or constructively, shares of our capital stock),
could, nevertheless, cause that individual or entity, or another individual or entity, to own constructively in excess of 9.8% in value or in number of shares, whichever is more restrictive, of the outstanding shares of the class or series of our
capital stock and thereby subject the shares to the ownership limit. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our board of directors may, in its sole discretion, prospectively or
retroactively, exempt a person from the ownership limit for one or more classes and/or series of our capital stock. However, our board of directors may not exempt any person whose ownership of our outstanding stock would result in our failing to
continue to qualify as a REIT. In order to be considered by our board of directors for exemption, a person also must provide such representations, covenants and undertakings as our board of directors may deem appropriate in order to conclude that
granting the exemption would not cause us to fail to continue to qualify as a REIT. As a condition of its waiver, our board of directors may require an opinion of counsel or IRS ruling satisfactory to our board of directors with respect to our
continued qualification as a REIT and may impose such conditions and restrictions as it deems appropriate. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our board of directors may
from time to time increase or decrease the ownership limit for one or more classes or series of our stock and for one or more persons; provided, however, that any decrease may be made only prospectively as to existing holders; and provided, further,
that the ownership limit may not be increased if, after giving effect to such increase, five or fewer individuals could own in the aggregate, more than 49.9% in value of the shares then outstanding or we would otherwise fail to qualify as a REIT.
The reduced ownership limit will not apply to any person or entity whose percentage ownership of shares of our capital stock of a class or series is in excess of such decreased ownership limit until such time as such person’s or entity’s
percentage of ownership of our capital stock of such class or series equals or falls below the decreased ownership limit, but any </P>

class or series of our capital stock, any vacancy on our board of directors may be filled only by a majority of the remaining directors, even if the remaining directors do not constitute a quorum, and any individual elected to fill such a vacancy

material harm to us through bad faith or active and deliberate dishonesty. This provision, when coupled with the exclusive power of our board of directors to fill vacancies on our board of directors, precludes stockholders from removing incumbent

is entitled to exercise or direct the exercise of the voting power of such shares in the election of directors: (1)&nbsp;a person who makes or proposes to make a control share acquisition; (2)&nbsp;an officer of the corporation; or (3)&nbsp;an
employee of the corporation who is also a director of the corporation. “Control shares” are shares of voting stock which, if aggregated with all other such shares of capital stock previously acquired by the acquirer, or in respect of which
the acquirer is able to exercise or direct the exercise of voting power (except solely by virtue of a revocable proxy), would entitle the acquirer to exercise voting power in electing directors within one of the following ranges of voting power: <FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">(A)&nbsp;one-tenth</FONT> or more but less than <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">one-third;</FONT> <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">(B)&nbsp;one-third</FONT> or more but less than a majority; or (C)&nbsp;a majority or more
of all voting power. Control shares do not include shares that the acquiring person is then entitled to vote as a result of having previously obtained stockholder approval or shares acquired directly from the corporation. A “control share
acquisition” means the direct or indirect acquisition of issued and outstanding control shares, subject to certain exceptions. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">A
person who has made or proposes to make a control share acquisition, upon satisfaction of certain conditions (including an undertaking to pay expenses and making an “acquiring person statement” as described in the MGCL), may compel our
board of directors to call a special meeting of stockholders to be held within 50&nbsp;days of demand to consider the voting rights of the shares. If no request for a meeting is made, the corporation may itself present the question at any
stockholders meeting. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">If voting rights are not approved at the meeting or if the acquiring person does not deliver an “acquiring
person statement” as required by the statute, then, subject to certain conditions and limitations, the corporation may redeem any or all of the control shares (except those for which voting rights have previously been approved) for fair value
determined, without regard to the absence of voting rights for the control shares, if a meeting of stockholders is held at which the voting rights of such shares are considered and not approved, as of the date of such meeting, or, if no such meeting
is held, as of the date of the last control share acquisition by the acquirer. If voting rights for control shares are approved at a stockholders meeting and the acquirer becomes entitled to vote a majority of the shares entitled to vote, all other
stockholders may exercise appraisal rights. The fair value of the shares as determined for purposes of such appraisal rights may not be less than the highest price per share paid by the acquirer in the control share acquisition. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The control share acquisition statute does not apply to (1)&nbsp;shares acquired in a merger, consolidation or share exchange if the
corporation is a party to the transaction or (2)&nbsp;acquisitions approved or exempted by the charter or bylaws of the corporation. Our bylaws currently contain a provision exempting from the control share acquisition statute any and all
acquisitions by any person of shares of our capital stock. There can be no assurance that such provision will not be amended or eliminated at any time in the future. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The following description contains general terms and provisions of the debt securities to which any prospectus supplement or related free
writing prospectus may relate. The particular terms of the debt securities offered by any prospectus supplement or any related free writing prospectus and the extent, if any, to which such general provisions may not apply to the debt securities so
offered will be described in the prospectus supplement or any free writing prospectus relating to such debt securities. Senior debt securities, if any, will be issued under a senior indenture between us and a trustee to be selected by us at or about
the time we offer our senior debt securities (a “senior indenture”). Subordinated debt securities, if any, will be issued under a subordinated indenture between us and a trustee to be selected by us at or about the time we offer our
subordinated debt securities (a “subordinated indenture”). A form of the senior indenture and a form of the subordinated indenture are filed as exhibits to the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As used in this prospectus, the term “indentures” refers to both the senior indenture and the subordinated indenture. The indentures
have or will be qualified under and governed by the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended (the “Trust Indenture Act”). As used in this prospectus, the term “trustee” refers to either the trustee under the senior indenture or
the trustee under the subordinated indenture, as applicable. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The following are summaries of material provisions included or anticipated
to be included, as applicable, in the senior indenture and the subordinated indenture or in supplements thereto. As summaries, they do not purport to be complete or restate the indentures in their entirety and are subject to, and qualified in their
entirety by reference to, all provisions of the indentures and the debt securities. We urge you to read the indentures, including any related supplemental indentures, applicable to a particular series of debt securities because they, and not this
description, define your rights as the holders of the debt securities. Except as we may otherwise indicate, the terms of the senior indenture and the subordinated indenture are substantially identical. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We may issue the securities offered by means of this prospectus in whole or in part in book-entry form, meaning that beneficial owners of the
securities will not receive certificates representing their ownership interests in the securities, except in the event the book-entry system for the securities is discontinued. If securities are issued in book-entry form, they may be evidenced by
one or more global securities that will be deposited with, or on behalf of, a depositary identified in the applicable prospectus supplement relating to the securities. DTC is expected to serve as depositary. Unless and until it is exchanged in whole
or in part for the individual securities represented thereby, a global security may not be transferred, except as a whole, by the depositary for the global security to a nominee of such depositary or by a nominee of such depositary to such
depositary or another nominee of such depositary or by the depositary or any nominee of such depositary to a successor depositary or a nominee of such successor. Global securities may be issued in either registered or bearer form and in either
temporary or permanent form. The specific terms of the depositary arrangement with respect to a class or series of securities that differ from the terms described herein will be described in the applicable prospectus supplement. </P>

registration and transfer system the respective principal amounts of the individual securities represented by such global security to the accounts of persons that have accounts with such depositary, who are called “participants.” Such
accounts shall be designated by the underwriters, dealers or agents with respect to the securities or by us if the securities are offered and sold directly by us. Ownership of beneficial interests in a global security will be limited to the
depositary’s participants or persons that may hold interests through such participants. Ownership of beneficial interests in the global security will be shown on, and the transfer of that ownership will be effected only through, records
maintained by the applicable depositary or its nominee (with respect to beneficial interests of participants) and records of the participants (with respect to beneficial interests of persons who hold through participants). The laws of some states
require that certain purchasers of securities take physical delivery of such securities in definitive form. Such limits and laws may impair the ability to own, pledge or transfer beneficial interests in a global security. </P>

the case may be, will be considered the sole owner or holder of the securities represented by such global security for all purposes under the applicable instrument defining the rights of a holder of the securities. Except as provided below or in the
applicable prospectus supplement, owners of beneficial interest in a global security will not be entitled to have any of the individual securities of the class or series represented by such global security registered in their names, will not receive
or be entitled to receive physical delivery of any such securities in definitive form and will not be considered the owners or holders thereof under the applicable instrument defining the rights of the holders of the securities. </P>

“Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations,” references to “TPG RE Finance Trust, Inc.,” “we,” “our” and “us” mean only TPG RE Finance Trust, Inc. and not its subsidiaries or other lower-tier
entities, except as otherwise indicated. This summary is based upon the Internal Revenue Code, the regulations promulgated by the U.S. Treasury Department, rulings and other administrative pronouncements issued by the IRS, and judicial decisions,
all as currently in effect, and all of which are subject to differing interpretations or to change, possibly with retroactive effect. The following discussion takes into account H.R. 1, informally titled the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the
“TCJA”). The TCJA makes major changes to the Internal Revenue Code, including several provisions of the Internal Revenue Code that may affect the taxation of REITs and their security holders. The most significant of these provisions are
described below. The individual and collective impact of these changes on REITs and their security holders is uncertain, and may not become evident for some period. Investors should consult their tax advisors regarding the implications of the TCJA
on their investment, including how the scheduled sunsetting of certain provisions of the TCJA may affect their investment. No assurance can be given that the IRS would not assert, or that a court would not sustain, a position contrary to any of the
tax consequences described below. We have not sought and will not seek a ruling from the IRS regarding any matter discussed in this prospectus. The summary is also based upon the assumption that we will operate our company and its subsidiaries and
affiliated entities in accordance with their applicable organizational documents or partnership agreements. This summary is for general information only and is not tax advice. It does not purport to discuss all aspects of U.S. federal income
taxation that may be important to a particular investor in light of its investment or tax circumstances, or to investors subject to special tax rules, such as: </P> <P STYLE="font-size:6pt;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt">&nbsp;</P>

have been organized and have operated in conformity with the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code, and we believe that our current organization and intended manner of operation will enable us to
continue to meet the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Vinson&nbsp;&amp; Elkins L.L.P. has acted as our tax counsel
in connection with the filing of this prospectus and our U.S. federal income tax status as a REIT. In connection with the filing of this prospectus, we will receive an opinion of Vinson&nbsp;&amp; Elkins L.L.P. to the effect that we qualified to be
taxed as a REIT under the U.S. federal income tax laws for our taxable years ended December&nbsp;31, 2014 through December&nbsp;31, 2017, and our organization and current and proposed method of operation will enable us to continue to qualify as a
REIT for our taxable years ending December&nbsp;31, 2018 and thereafter. It must be emphasized that the opinion of Vinson&nbsp;&amp; Elkins L.L.P. will be based on various assumptions relating to our organization and operation, and will be
conditioned upon fact-based representations and covenants made by our management regarding our organization, assets, and income, and the past, present and future conduct of our business operations. While we intend to operate so that we will qualify
as a REIT, given the highly complex nature of the rules governing REITs, the ongoing importance of factual determinations, and the possibility of future changes in our circumstances, no assurance can be given by Vinson&nbsp;&amp; Elkins L.L.P. or by
us that we will qualify as a REIT for any particular year. The opinion will be expressed as of the date issued. Vinson&nbsp;&amp; Elkins L.L.P. will have no obligation to advise us or our stockholders of any subsequent change in the matters stated,
represented or assumed, or of any subsequent change in the applicable law. You should be aware that opinions of counsel are not binding on the IRS, and no assurance can be given that the IRS will not challenge the conclusions set forth in such
opinions. Vinson&nbsp;&amp; Elkins L.L.P.’s opinion does not foreclose the possibility that we may have to use one or more of the REIT savings provisions described below, which would require us to pay an excise or penalty tax (which could be
material) in order to maintain REIT qualification. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Qualification and taxation as a REIT depends on our ability to meet on a continuing
basis, through actual operating results, distribution levels, and diversity of stock and asset ownership, various qualification requirements imposed upon REITs by the Internal Revenue Code, the compliance with which will not be monitored or reviewed
on a continuing basis by Vinson&nbsp;&amp; Elkins L.L.P. Our ability to qualify as a REIT also requires that we satisfy certain asset tests, some of which depend upon the fair market values of assets that we own directly or indirectly. Such values
may not be susceptible to a precise determination. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that the actual results of our operations for any taxable year will satisfy such requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT. For a discussion of the
tax consequences of failure to qualify as a REIT, see “—Failure to Qualify.” </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Taxation of REITs in General </I></B></P>

requirements imposed upon REITs by the Internal Revenue Code. The material qualification requirements are summarized below under “—Requirements for Qualification—General.” While we intend to operate so that we qualify as a REIT,
no assurance can be given that the IRS will not challenge our qualification, or that we will be able to operate in accordance with the REIT requirements in the future. See “—Failure to Qualify.” </P>

be met during a corporation’s initial tax year as a REIT (which, in our case, was 2014). In addition, our charter restricts the ownership and transfer of our stock which is intended to assist us in satisfying the stock ownership requirements
described in conditions (5)&nbsp;and (6)&nbsp;above. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">To monitor compliance with the stock ownership requirements, we generally are
required to maintain records regarding the actual ownership of our stock. To do so, we must demand written statements each year from the record holders of significant percentages of our stock pursuant to which the record holders must disclose the
actual owners of the stock (that is, the persons required to include our dividends in their gross income). We must maintain a list of those persons failing or refusing to comply with this demand as part of our records. We could be subject to
monetary penalties if we fail to comply with these recordkeeping requirements. If you fail or refuse to comply with the demands, you will be required by U.S. Treasury Regulations to submit a statement with your tax return disclosing the actual
ownership of our stock and other information. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Internal Revenue Code provides relief from violations of the REIT gross income
requirements, as described below under “—Income Tests,” in cases where a violation is due to reasonable cause and not to willful neglect, and other requirements are met, including the payment of a penalty tax that is based upon the
magnitude of the violation. In addition, certain provisions of the Internal Revenue Code extend similar relief in the case of certain violations of the REIT asset requirements (see “—Asset Tests” below) and other REIT requirements,
again provided that the violation is due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect, and other conditions are met, including the payment of a penalty tax. If we fail to satisfy any of the various REIT requirements, there can be no assurance that
these relief provisions would be available to enable us to maintain our qualification as a REIT, and, if such relief provisions are available, the amount of any resultant penalty tax could be substantial. </P>

Each of these entities must meet all of the REIT qualification tests discussed herein. Each of them also may be subject to tax on certain of its income as described above. Depending on the percentage of our ownership in any subsidiary REIT, we may
make a protective TRS election with respect to such subsidiary REIT. If the IRS respects our protective TRS election with respect to such subsidiary REIT, the failure of such subsidiary REIT to qualify as a REIT would only cause us to fail to
qualify as a REIT to the extent that the total value of interests in TRSs represent more than 20% of our assets. See “—Asset Tests” below. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Ownership of Partnership Interests</I>. If we are a partner in an entity that is treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax
purposes, U.S. Treasury Regulations provide that we are deemed to own our proportionate share of the partnership’s assets, and to earn our proportionate share of the partnership’s income, for purposes of the asset and gross income tests
applicable to REITs. Our proportionate share of a partnership’s assets and income is based on our capital interest in the partnership (except that for purposes of the value prong of the 10% asset test, our proportionate share of the
partnership’s assets is based on our proportionate interest in the equity and certain debt securities issued by the partnership). In addition, the assets and gross income of the partnership are deemed to retain the same character in our hands.
Thus, our proportionate share of the assets and items of income of any of our subsidiary partnerships will be treated as our assets and items of income for purposes of applying the REIT requirements. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Disregarded Subsidiaries</I>. If we own a corporate subsidiary that is a “qualified REIT subsidiary,” that subsidiary is

limited liability companies that have not elected to be taxed as corporations for U.S. federal income tax purposes, are also generally disregarded as separate entities for U.S. federal income tax purposes, including for purposes of the REIT income
and asset tests. Disregarded subsidiaries, along with any partnerships in which we hold an equity interest, are sometimes referred to herein as “pass-through subsidiaries.” </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In the event that a disregarded subsidiary of ours ceases to be wholly-owned—for example, if any equity interest in the subsidiary is
acquired by a person other than us or another disregarded subsidiary of ours—or is classified as a TRS, the subsidiary’s separate existence would no longer be disregarded for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Instead, the subsidiary would
have multiple owners and would be treated as either a partnership or a taxable corporation. Such an event could, depending on the circumstances, adversely affect our ability to satisfy the various asset and gross income requirements applicable to
REITs, including the requirement that REITs generally may not own, directly or indirectly, more than 10% of the securities of another corporation unless it is a REIT, a TRS or a qualified REIT subsidiary. See “—Asset Tests” and
“—Income Tests.” </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Taxable Subsidiaries</I>. In general, we may jointly elect with a subsidiary corporation, whether or
not wholly-owned, to treat such subsidiary corporation as a TRS. We generally may not own more than 10% of the securities of a taxable corporation, as measured by voting power or value, unless we and such corporation elect to treat such corporation
as a TRS. The separate existence of a TRS or other taxable corporation is not ignored for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Accordingly, a TRS or other taxable corporation generally would be subject to corporate income tax on its earnings, which may
reduce the cash flow that we and our subsidiaries generate in the aggregate, and may reduce our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We are not treated as holding the assets of a TRS or other taxable subsidiary corporation or as receiving any income that the subsidiary
earns. Rather, the stock issued by a taxable subsidiary to us is an asset in our hands, and we treat the dividends paid to us from such taxable subsidiary, if any, as income. This treatment can affect our income and asset test calculations, as
described below. Because we do not include the assets and income of TRSs or other taxable subsidiary corporations in determining our compliance with the REIT requirements, we may use such entities to undertake indirectly activities that the REIT
rules might otherwise preclude us from doing directly or through pass-through subsidiaries. For example, we may use TRSs or other taxable subsidiary corporations to conduct activities that give rise to certain categories of income such as management
fees or to conduct activities that, if conducted by us directly, could be treated in our hands as prohibited transactions. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">For taxable
years beginning after December&nbsp;31, 2017, deductions are disallowed for business interest expense (even if paid to third parties) in excess of the sum of a taxpayer’s business interest income and 30% of the adjusted taxable income of the
business, which is its taxable income computed without regard to business interest income or expense, net operating losses or the pass-through income deduction (and for taxable years before 2022, excludes depreciation and amortization). Such
limitations may also impact the amount of U.S. federal income tax paid by any of our TRSs. Accordingly, if we lend money to a TRS, the TRS may be unable to deduct all or a part of the interest paid on that loan, and the lack of an interest deduction
could result in a material increase in the amount of tax paid by the TRS. Further, the TRS rules impose a 100% excise tax on certain transactions between a TRS and its parent REIT, such as intercompany loans, or the REIT’s tenants that are not
conducted on an <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">arm’s-length</FONT> basis. We intend to scrutinize all of our transactions with our TRSs and to conduct such transactions on an <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">arm’s-length</FONT> basis;
however, we cannot assure you that we will be successful in avoiding this excise tax. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We may hold assets in one or more TRSs, subject to
the limitation that securities in TRSs may not represent more than 20% of our assets (25% for our 2017 and prior taxable years). In general, we intend that loans that we originate or purchase, and properties that we purchase or receive upon
foreclosure, with an intention of promptly selling them that might expose us to a 100% tax on “prohibited transactions” will be originated or transferred to and sold by a TRS. The TRS through which any such sales are made may be treated as

as a REIT, we must satisfy two gross income requirements on an annual basis. First, at least 75% of our gross income for each taxable year, excluding gross income from sales of inventory or dealer property in “prohibited transactions” and
certain hedging transactions, generally must be derived from investments relating to real property or mortgages on real property, including interest income derived from mortgage loans secured by real property (including certain types of
mortgage-backed securities), “rents from real property,” dividends received from other REITs, income and gain from foreclosure property, specified income from temporary investments, and gain from the sale of “real estate assets”
(effective for taxable years beginning after December&nbsp;31, 2015, excluding gain from the sale of a debt instrument issued by a “publicly offered REIT” (i.e., a REIT which is required to file annual and periodic reports with the SEC
under the Exchange Act) to the extent not secured by real property or an interest in real property) not held for sale to customers. Second, at least 95% of our gross income in each taxable year, excluding gross income from prohibited transactions
and certain hedging transactions, must be derived from some combination of income that qualifies under the 75% gross income test described above, as well as other dividends, interest, and gain from the sale or disposition of stock or securities,
which need not have any relation to real property. Income and gain from certain hedging transactions will be excluded from both the numerator and the denominator for purposes of both the 75% and 95% gross income tests. See “—Derivatives
and Hedging Transactions.” </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Interest income generally constitutes qualifying mortgage interest for purposes of the 75% gross income
test (as described above) to the extent that the obligation upon which such interest is paid is secured by a mortgage on real property (and, for taxable years beginning after December&nbsp;31, 2015, a mortgage on an interest in real property). If we
receive interest income with respect to a mortgage loan that is secured by both real property and other property, and the highest principal amount of the loan outstanding during a taxable year exceeds the fair market value of the real property on
the date that we acquired or originated the mortgage loan, the interest income will be apportioned between the real property and the other collateral, and our income from the arrangement will qualify for purposes of the 75% gross income test only to
the extent that the interest is allocable to the real property. Even if a loan is not secured by real property, or is undersecured, the income that it generates may nonetheless qualify for purposes of the 95% gross income test. For taxable years
beginning after December&nbsp;31, 2015, in the case of mortgage loans secured by both real property and personal property, if the fair market value of such personal property does not exceed 15% of the total fair market value of all such property
securing the loan, then the personal property securing the loan will be treated as real property for purposes of determining whether the mortgage loan is a qualifying asset for the 75% asset test and the related interest income qualifies for
purposes of the 75% gross income test. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">To the extent that the terms of a loan provide for contingent interest that is based on the cash
proceeds realized upon the sale of the property securing the loan (a “shared appreciation provision”), income attributable to the participation feature will be treated as gain from the sale of the underlying property, which generally will
be qualifying income for purposes of both the 75% and 95% gross income tests provided that the property is not held as inventory or dealer property. To the extent that we derive interest income from a mortgage loan, or income from the rental of real
property where all or a portion of the amount of interest or rental income payable is contingent, such income generally will qualify for purposes of the gross income tests only if it is based upon the gross receipts or sales, and not the net income
or profits, of the borrower or lessee. This limitation does not apply, however, where the borrower or lessee leases substantially all of its interest in the property to tenants or subtenants, to the extent that the rental income derived by the
borrower or lessee, as the case may be, would qualify as rents from real property had we earned the income directly. </P>

(“CMBS”) that are either pass-through certificates or collateralized loan obligations as well as mortgage loans and mezzanine loans. We expect that the CMBS will be treated either as interests in a grantor trust or as interests in a REMIC
for U.S. federal income tax purposes and that substantially all interest income from our CMBS will be qualifying income for the 95% gross income test. In the case of CMBS treated as interests in grantor trusts, we will be treated as owning an
undivided beneficial ownership interest in the mortgage loans held by the grantor trust. The interest on such mortgage loans will be qualifying income for purposes of the 75% gross income test to the extent that such loans are secured by real
property, as discussed above. In the case of CMBS treated as interests in a REMIC, income derived from REMIC interests will generally be treated as qualifying income for purposes of the 75% and 95% gross income tests. If less than 95% of the assets
of the REMIC are real estate assets, however, then only a proportionate part of our interest in the REMIC and income derived from the interest will qualify for purposes of the 75% gross income test. In addition, some REMIC regular interests are
benefitted by interest swap or cap contracts or other derivative instruments that could produce some <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-qualifying</FONT> income for the holder of the REMIC regular interests. We expect that substantially all of our
income from mortgage related securities will be qualifying income for purposes of the REIT gross income tests. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">See below under

subsidiaries have invested and will continue to invest in mezzanine loans, which are loans secured by equity interests in an entity that directly or indirectly owns real property, rather than by a direct mortgage of the real property. The IRS has
issued Revenue Procedure <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">2003-65,</FONT> which provides a safe harbor applicable to mezzanine loans. Under the Revenue Procedure, if a mezzanine loan meets each of the requirements contained in the Revenue Procedure,
(1)&nbsp;the mezzanine loan will be treated by the IRS as a real estate asset for purposes of the asset tests described below, and (2)&nbsp;interest derived from the mezzanine loan will be treated as qualifying mortgage interest for purposes of the
75% income test. Although the Revenue Procedure provides a safe harbor on which taxpayers may rely, it does not prescribe rules of substantive tax law. We intend to structure any investments in mezzanine loans in a manner that complies with the
various requirements applicable to our qualification as a REIT. To the extent that any of our mezzanine loans do not meet all of the requirements for reliance on the safe harbor set forth in the Revenue Procedure, however, there can be no assurance
that the IRS will not challenge the tax treatment of these loans. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We may hold certain participation interests, including B Notes, in
mortgage loans and mezzanine loans. Such interests in an underlying loan are created by virtue of a participation or similar agreement to which the originator of the loan is a party, along with one or more participants. The borrower on the
underlying loan is typically not a party to the participation agreement. The performance of this investment depends upon the performance of the underlying loan, and if the underlying borrower defaults, the participant typically has no recourse
against the originator of the loan. The originator often retains a senior position in the underlying loan, and grants junior participations which absorb losses first in the event of a default by the borrower. We believe that our participation
interests will qualify as real estate assets for purposes of the REIT asset tests described below, and that the interest that we will derive from such investments will be treated as qualifying mortgage interest for purposes of the 75% income test.
The appropriate treatment of participation interests for U.S. federal income tax purposes is not entirely certain, however, and no assurance can be given that the IRS will not challenge our treatment of our participation interests. In the event of a
determination that such participation interests do not qualify as real estate assets, or that the income that we will derive from such participation interests does not qualify as mortgage interest for purposes of the REIT asset and income tests, we
could be subject to a penalty tax, or could fail to qualify as a REIT. See “—Taxation of REITs in General,” “—Requirements for Qualification—General,” “—Asset Tests” and “—Failure to

property” in satisfying the gross income requirements described above only if several conditions are met. If rent is partly attributable to personal property leased in connection with a lease of real property, the portion of the rent that is
attributable to the personal property will not qualify as “rents from real property” unless it constitutes 15% or less of the total rent received under the lease. In addition, the amount of rent must not be based in whole or in part on the
income or profits of any person. Amounts received as rent, however, generally will not be excluded from rents from real property solely by reason of being based on fixed percentages of gross receipts or sales. Moreover, for rents received to qualify
as “rents from real property,” we generally must not operate or manage the property or furnish or render services to the tenants of such property, other than through an “independent contractor” from which we derive no revenue. We
are permitted, however, to perform services that are “usually or customarily rendered” in connection with the rental of space for occupancy only and which are not otherwise considered rendered to the occupant of the property. In addition,
we may directly or indirectly provide <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-customary</FONT> services to tenants of our properties without disqualifying all of the rent from the property if the payments for such services do not exceed 1% of the total
gross income from the property. For purposes of this test, we are deemed to have received income from such <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-customary</FONT> services in an amount at least 150% of the direct cost of providing the services.
Moreover, we are generally permitted to provide services to tenants or others through a TRS without disqualifying the rental income received from tenants for purposes of the income tests. Also, rental income will qualify as rents from real property
only to the extent that we do not directly or constructively hold a 10% or greater interest, as measured by vote or value, in the lessee’s equity. </P>

is entered into during the ordinary course of our business, hedges risks associated with indebtedness issued by us or our pass-through subsidiary that is incurred to acquire or carry “real estate assets” (as described below under

any item of income or gain that is qualifying income for purposes of the 75% gross income test, foreign currency gain attributable to the acquisition or ownership of (or becoming or being the obligor under) obligations secured by mortgages on real
property or on interests in real property and certain foreign currency gain attributable to certain “qualified business units” of a REIT. “Passive foreign exchange gain” will be excluded from gross income for purposes of the 95%
gross income test. Passive foreign exchange gain generally includes real estate foreign exchange gain as described above and also includes foreign currency gain attributable to any item of income or gain that is qualifying income for purposes of the
95% gross income test and foreign currency gain attributable to the acquisition or ownership of (or becoming or being the obligor under) obligations. Because passive foreign exchange gain includes real estate foreign exchange gain, real estate
foreign exchange gain is excluded from gross income for purposes of both the 75% and 95% gross income tests. These exclusions for real estate foreign exchange gain and passive foreign exchange gain do not apply to foreign currency gain derived from
dealing, or engaging in substantial and regular trading, in securities. Such gain is treated as <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-qualifying</FONT> income for purposes of both the 75% and 95% gross income tests. </P>

(2)&nbsp;following our identification of the failure to meet the 75% or 95% gross income test for any taxable year, we file a schedule with the IRS setting forth each item of our gross income for purposes of the 75% or 95% gross income test for such
taxable year in accordance with U.S. Treasury Regulations yet to be issued. It is not possible to state whether we would be entitled to the benefit of these relief provisions in all circumstances. If these relief provisions are inapplicable to a
particular set of circumstances, we will not qualify as a REIT. As discussed above under “—Taxation of REITs in General,” even where these relief provisions apply, the Internal Revenue Code imposes a tax based upon the amount by which

value of our total assets must be represented by some combination of “real estate assets,” cash, cash items, U.S. government securities, and, under some circumstances, stock or debt instruments purchased with new capital. For this purpose,
real estate assets include interests in real property, such as land, buildings, leasehold interests in real property, stock of other REITs, CMBS structured as grantor trusts or interests in REMICs and mortgage loans, and, effective for taxable years
beginning after December&nbsp;31, 2015, personal property leased in connection with real property to the extent that rents attributable to such personal property are treated as “rents from real property,” and debt instruments issued by

indebtedness will be subject to, and may cause a violation of, the asset tests unless the indebtedness is a qualifying mortgage asset, or other conditions are met. Similarly, although stock of another REIT is a qualifying asset for purposes of the
REIT asset tests, any <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-mortgage</FONT> debt that is issued by another REIT may not so qualify (such debt, however, will not be treated as a “security” for purposes of the value prong of the 10% asset

securities include instruments that constitute “straight debt,” which includes, among other things, securities having certain contingency features. A security does not qualify as “straight debt” where a REIT (or a controlled TRS
of the REIT) owns other securities of the same issuer which do not qualify as straight debt, unless the value of those other securities constitutes, in the aggregate, 1% or less of the total value of that issuer’s outstanding securities. In
addition to straight debt, the Internal Revenue Code provides that certain other securities will not violate the 10% value test. Such securities include (a)&nbsp;any loan made to an individual or an estate, (b)&nbsp;certain rental agreements
pursuant to which one or more payments are to be made in subsequent years (other than agreements between a REIT and certain persons related to the REIT under attribution rules), (c) any obligation to pay rents from real property, (d)&nbsp;securities
issued by governmental entities that are not dependent in whole or in part on the profits of (or payments made by) a <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-governmental</FONT> entity, (e)&nbsp;any security (including debt securities) issued by another
REIT, and (f)&nbsp;any debt instrument issued by a partnership if the partnership’s income is of a nature that it would satisfy the 75% gross income test described above under “—Income Tests.” In applying the 10% value test, a
debt security issued by a partnership is not taken into account to the extent, if any, of the REIT’s proportionate interest in the equity and certain debt securities issued by that partnership. </P>

as mortgage loans and mezzanine loans. We expect that the CMBS will be treated either as interests in grantor trusts or as interests in REMICs for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In the case of CMBS treated as interests in grantor trusts, we would
be treated as owning an undivided beneficial ownership interest in the mortgage loans held by the grantor trust. Such mortgage loans will generally qualify as real estate assets to the extent that they are secured by real property. We expect that
substantially all of our CMBS treated as interests in grantor trusts will qualify as real estate assets. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Any interests that we hold in a
REMIC, including CMBS that are structured as interests in REMICs, will generally qualify as real estate assets, and income derived from REMIC interests will generally be treated as qualifying income for purposes of the REIT income tests described
above. If less than 95% of the assets of a REMIC are real estate assets, however, then only a proportionate part of our interest in the REMIC and income derived from the interest qualifies for purposes of the REIT asset and income tests. If we hold
a “residual interest” in a REMIC or in a TMP, from which we derive “excess inclusion income,” we will be required to either distribute the excess inclusion income or pay tax on it (or a combination of the two), even though we may
not receive the income in cash. To the extent that distributed excess inclusion income is allocable to a particular stockholder, the income (1)&nbsp;would not be allowed to be offset by any net operating losses otherwise available to the

record ownership of the assets to the counterparty during the term of the agreement. It is possible, however, that the IRS could assert that we did not own the assets during the term of the secured revolving repurchase facility, in which case we

total assets, or the value of any particular security or securities. Moreover, values of some assets, including instruments issued in securitization transactions, may not be susceptible to a precise determination, and values are subject to change in
the future. Furthermore, the proper classification of an instrument as debt or equity for U.S. federal income tax purposes may be uncertain in some circumstances, which could affect the application of the REIT asset requirements. Accordingly, there
can be no assurance that the IRS will not contend that our interests in our subsidiaries or in the securities of other issuers cause a violation of the REIT asset tests. </P>

of each asset causing the failure, (2)&nbsp;the failure is due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect, (3)&nbsp;the REIT pays a tax equal to the greater of (a) $50,000 per failure, and (b)&nbsp;the product of the net income generated by the

or stock at the election of each stockholder, where the aggregate amount of cash to be distributed in such dividend may be subject to limitation. In such case, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the amount of the dividend paid in stock will be
equal to the amount of cash that could have been received instead of stock. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We may satisfy the 90% distribution test with taxable

Pursuant to Revenue Procedure <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">2017-45,</FONT> effective for distributions declared on or after August&nbsp;11, 2017, the IRS will treat the distribution of stock pursuant to an elective cash/stock dividend as a
distribution of property under Section&nbsp;301 of the Internal Revenue Code (i.e., a dividend), as long as at least 20% of the total dividend is available in cash and certain other parameters detailed in the Revenue Procedure are satisfied.
Although we have no current intention of paying dividends in our own stock, if in the future we choose to pay dividends in our own stock, our stockholders may be required to pay tax in excess of the cash that they receive. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The TCJA limits a taxpayer’s net interest expense deduction to 30% of the sum of adjusted taxable income, business interest, and certain
other amounts. Adjusted taxable income does not include items of income or expense not allocable to a trade or business, business interest or expense, the new deduction for qualified business income, net operating losses (“NOLs”), and for
years prior to 2022, deductions for depreciation, amortization, or depletion. For partnerships, the interest deduction limit is applied at the partnership level, subject to certain adjustments to the partners for unused deduction limitations at the
partnership level. The TCJA allows a real property trade or business to elect out of this interest limit so long as it uses a <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">40-year</FONT> recovery period for nonresidential real property, a <FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">30-year</FONT> recovery period for residential rental property, and a <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">20-year</FONT> recovery period for related improvements. For this purpose, a real property trade or business is any
real property development, redevelopment, construction, reconstruction, acquisition, conversion, rental, operating, management, leasing, or brokerage trade or business. As a mortgage REIT, we do not believe that our business constitutes a “real
property trade or business” within the meaning of the TCJA. However, as a mortgage REIT, we do not believe we will be negatively impacted by the 30% limitation on the deductibility of interest imposed

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We may acquire debt instruments in the secondary market for less than their face amount. The discount at which such debt instruments are
acquired may reflect doubts about their ultimate collectability rather than current market interest rates. The amount of such discount will nevertheless generally be treated as “market discount” for U.S. federal income tax purposes. We
will generally accrue market discount during the term of the debt instrument and report the accrued market discount as income when, and to the extent that, any payment of principal of the debt instrument is made. Payments on certain loans are made
monthly, and consequently accrued market discount may have to be included in income each month as if the debt instrument were assured of ultimately being collected in full. If that turned out not to be the case, and we eventually collected less on
the debt instrument than the amount we paid for it plus the market discount we had previously reported as income, there would be a bad debt deduction available to us at that time. Nevertheless, our (and our stockholders’) ability to benefit
from that bad debt deduction would depend on our having taxable income in that later taxable year. REITs may not carry back net operating losses, so this possible “income early, losses later” phenomenon could adversely affect us and our
stockholders if it were persistent and in significant amounts. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Some of the CMBS or other debt instruments that we acquire may have been

income tax rules even though smaller or no cash payments are received on such debt instrument. As in the case of the market discount discussed in the preceding paragraph, the constant yield in question will be determined and income will be accrued
based on the assumption that all future payments due on the debt instrument in question will be made, with consequences similar to those described in the previous paragraph if all payments on the debt instrument are not made. </P>

tax (such as a government entity), the REIT may be subject to tax on this income at the highest applicable corporate tax rate (currently 21%, but 35% for taxable years beginning before January&nbsp;1, 2018). In that case, the REIT could reduce
distributions to such stockholders by the amount of such tax paid by the REIT attributable to such stockholder’s ownership. U.S. Treasury Regulations provide that such a reduction in distributions does not give rise to a preferential dividend
that could adversely affect the REIT’s compliance with its distribution requirements. See “—Annual Distribution Requirements.” The manner in which excess inclusion income is calculated, or would be allocated to stockholders,
including allocations among shares of different classes of stock, is not clear under current law. As required by IRS guidance, we intend to make any such determinations using a reasonable method. However, there can be no assurance that the IRS would
not challenge our method of making any such determinations. If the IRS were to disagree with any such determinations made or with the method used by us, the amount of any excess inclusion income required to be taken into account by one or more
stockholders could be significantly increased. <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">Tax-exempt</FONT> investors, foreign investors and taxpayers with net operating losses should carefully consider the tax consequences described above, and are urged to

proportionate shares of the items of income, gain, loss, deduction and credit of a partnership, and are potentially subject to tax on these items, without regard to whether the partners receive a distribution from the partnership. For taxable years
beginning after December&nbsp;31, 2017, however, the tax liability for adjustments to a partnership’s tax returns made as a result of an audit by the IRS will be imposed on the partnership itself in certain circumstances absent an election to
the contrary. See “—Partnership Audit Rules” below. We will include in our income our proportionate share of these partnership items for purposes of the various REIT income tests and in computation of our REIT taxable income.
Moreover, for purposes of the REIT asset tests, we will include in our calculations our proportionate share of any assets held by partnerships. Our proportionate share of a partnership’s assets and income is based on our capital interest in the
partnership (except that for purposes of the 10% value test, our proportionate share is based on our proportionate interest in the equity and certain debt securities issued by the partnership). See “Taxation of TPG RE Finance Trust,

cause us to fail a REIT gross income or asset test, and that we would not become aware of such action in time to dispose of our interest in the partnership or limited liability company or take other corrective action on a timely basis. In that case,

corporation and therefore could be subject to an entity-level tax on its income. In such a situation, the character of our assets and items of gross income would change and could preclude us from satisfying the REIT asset tests or the gross income
tests as discussed in “Taxation of TPG RE Finance Trust, Inc.— Asset Tests” and “—Income Tests,” and in turn could prevent us from qualifying as a REIT, unless we are eligible for relief from the violation pursuant to

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Under the Internal Revenue Code and the U.S. Treasury Regulations, income, gain, loss and deduction attributable to appreciated or depreciated
property that is contributed to a partnership in exchange for an interest in the partnership must be allocated for tax purposes so that the contributing partner is charged with, or benefits from, the unrealized gain or unrealized loss associated
with the property at the time of the contribution. The amount of the unrealized gain or unrealized loss is generally equal to the difference between the fair market value of the contributed property at the time of contribution, and the adjusted tax
basis of such property at the time of contribution (a <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">“book-tax</FONT> difference”). Such allocations are solely for U.S. federal income tax purposes and do not affect the book capital accounts or other
economic or legal arrangements among the partners. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">To the extent that any of our subsidiary partnerships acquires appreciated (or
depreciated) properties by way of capital contributions from its partners, allocations would need to be made in a manner consistent with these requirements. Where a partner contributes cash to a partnership at a time that the partnership holds
appreciated (or depreciated) property, the U.S. Treasury Regulations provide for a similar allocation of these items to the other (i.e., <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-contributing)</FONT> partners. These rules may apply to a contribution that
we make to any subsidiary partnerships of the cash proceeds received in offerings of our stock. As a result, the partners of our subsidiary partnerships, including us, could be allocated greater or lesser amounts of depreciation and taxable income
in respect of a partnership’s properties than would be the case if all of the partnership’s assets (including any contributed assets) had a tax basis equal to their fair market values at the time of any contributions to that partnership.
This could cause us to recognize, over a period of time, taxable income in excess of cash flow from the partnership, which might adversely affect our ability to comply with the REIT distribution requirements discussed above. </P>

considered to be owned by the U.S. Holder by reason of certain constructive ownership rules set forth in the Internal Revenue Code, as well as stock actually owned, generally must be taken into account. Because the determination as to whether any of
the three alternative tests of Section&nbsp;302(b) of the Internal Revenue Code described above will be satisfied with respect to any particular U.S. Holder of preferred stock depends upon the facts and circumstances at the time that the
determination must be made, prospective investors are advised to consult their tax advisors to determine such tax treatment. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">If a

our capital stock or it may be lost. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Under proposed U.S. Treasury Regulations, if any portion of the amount received by a U.S. Holder on

the redemption on a <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">pro-rata,</FONT> <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">share-by-share,</FONT></FONT> basis. The amount applied to each share will first reduce the redeemed
holder’s basis in that share and any excess after the basis is reduced to zero will result in taxable gain. If the redeemed holder has different bases in its shares, then the amount allocated could reduce some of the basis in certain shares
while reducing all the basis and giving rise to taxable gain in others. Thus the redeemed holder could have gain even if such holder’s basis in all its shares of the redeemed class exceeded such portion. </P>

unredeemed shares of preferred stock of the same class (if any), but not to any other class of stock held (directly or indirectly) by the redeemed holder. Instead, any unrecovered basis in the redeemed shares of preferred stock would be treated as a
deferred loss to be recognized when certain conditions are satisfied. The proposed U.S. Treasury Regulations would be effective for transactions that occur after the date the regulations are published as final U.S. Treasury Regulations. There can,

earned through pass-through entities and reduce the top effective rate applicable to ordinary dividends from REITs to 29.6% (through a 20% deduction for ordinary REIT dividends received) and various deductions have been eliminated or limited. The
TCJA generally requires us to include certain amounts in our taxable income no later than the time such amounts are reflected on certain financial statements. The application of this rule may require the accrual of income with respect to our debt
instruments, including original issue discount or market discount, earlier than would be the case under the general tax rules, although the precise application of this rule is unclear at this time. This rule generally will be effective for tax years

discount, for tax years beginning after December&nbsp;31, 2018. To the extent that this rule requires the accrual of income earlier than under the general tax rules, it could increase our
“phantom income,” which may make it more likely that we could be required to borrow funds or take other action to satisfy the REIT distribution requirements for the taxable year in which this “phantom income” is recognized. Most
of the TCJA changes applicable to individuals are temporary and apply only to taxable years beginning after December&nbsp;31, 2017 and before January&nbsp;1, 2026. There are only minor changes to the REIT rules (other than the 20% deduction
applicable to individuals for ordinary REIT dividends received). The TCJA makes numerous other large and small changes to the tax rules that do not affect REITs directly but may affect our stockholders and may indirectly affect us. </P>

administrative action at any time, which could affect the U.S. federal income tax treatment of an investment in us. The REIT rules are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process and by the IRS and the U.S. Treasury
Department which may result in statutory changes as well as revisions to regulations and interpretations. Changes to the U.S. federal tax laws and interpretations thereof could adversely affect an investment in our capital stock. We cannot predict
how changes in the tax laws might affect our stockholders or us. New legislation, U.S. Treasury Regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions could significantly and negatively affect our ability to continue to qualify as a REIT, or
the U.S. federal income tax consequences to our stockholders and us of such qualification, or could have other adverse consequences, including with respect to ownership of our securities. For example, lower revised tax rates for corporations, or for
individuals, trusts and estates, might cause current or potential stockholders to perceive investments in REITs to be relatively less attractive than is the case under current law. Investors are urged to consult their tax advisors with respect to
the status of legislative, regulatory or administrative developments and proposals and their potential effect on an investment in our securities. </P>
