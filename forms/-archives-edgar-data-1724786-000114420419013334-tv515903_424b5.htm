that arise under certain of the bank&rsquo;s revolving credit card accounts. The accounts designated to the trust were originated
under the bank&rsquo;s Retail Card platform. Retail Card is a leading provider of private label credit cards, and also provides
co-branded cards and small and medium-sized business credit products. Unless the context requires otherwise, references herein
to co-branded cards are references to dual cards, which combine features and benefits of private label credit cards with multi-merchant
acceptance of general purpose credit cards. We refer to the receivables securing the notes as the transferred receivables, and
we refer to the accounts that have been designated as trust accounts as the trust portfolio. The bank has selected the accounts
in the current trust portfolio from among a subset of its dual card and private label credit card programs.</P>

to own the credit card accounts. As owner of the accounts, the bank retains the right to change various account terms or treatment,
including finance charges, other fees, the required monthly minimum payment, payment due dates and allocation of payments. These
changes may be voluntary on the part of the bank or may be required by law, market conditions or other reasons. Changes in the
terms or treatment of the accounts may reduce the amount of receivables arising under the accounts, reduce the portfolio yield,
reduce the amount of collections on those receivables or otherwise alter payment patterns. Payments to you could be accelerated,

credit to the bank&rsquo;s customers under its credit card programs is the risk of default or bankruptcy of the customer, resulting
in the customer&rsquo;s account balance being charged-off as uncollectible. The bank relies principally on the customer&rsquo;s
creditworthiness for repayment of the account and usually has no other recourse for collection. In certain circumstances, the bank
may not be able to successfully identify and evaluate the creditworthiness of cardholders to minimize delinquencies and losses.
General economic factors, such as the rate of inflation, unemployment levels and interest rates, may result in greater delinquencies
that lead to greater credit losses among customers.</P>

not have credit card operations. If The Bank of New York Mellon is automatically appointed as successor servicer it may not have

Monthly Period. There is no guarantee that the bank will have sufficient accounts to designate to the trust. This could cause a
possible delay or reduction in payments on your notes. If we do not transfer sufficient receivables to the trust within the grace

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-indent: 0.25in">The trust has issued other series of notes
and expects to issue additional series of notes from time to time. Other series of notes may have terms that are different than
the terms for the SynchronySeries, including different early amortization events or events of default. In addition, the early amortization
events and events of default for other series of notes may be subject to grace periods or rights to cure that are different than
the grace periods or rights to cure applicable to the same or similar early amortization events or events of default for the SynchronySeries.
As a result, early amortization events may occur with respect to other series of notes prior to the payment of principal on the
SynchronySeries. This could reduce the amount of principal collections available to the SynchronySeries at the time principal collections
begin to be accumulated or paid for the benefit of your notes and could cause a possible delay or reduction in payments on your
notes. Additional series of notes may be issued without any requirement for notice to, or consent from, existing noteholders. For

the timing and amount of payments on outstanding notes. For example, if additional notes are issued after your notes and those

declines, collections of finance charge receivables may be reduced without a corresponding reduction in the amounts of interest
payable on your notes and other amounts required to be paid out of collections of finance charge receivables. If the interest rate
on the accounts declines or the interest rate on a series increases, this could decrease the spread, or difference, between collections
of finance charge receivables and those collections allocated to make interest payments on your notes. This would increase the
risk of early repayment of your notes, as well as the risk that there may not be sufficient collections to make all required payments

ratings are not a recommendation to purchase, hold or sell the offered notes, inasmuch as the rating does not comment as to market
price or suitability for a particular investor. A rating of the offered notes addresses the likelihood of the timely payment of

There is no assurance that a rating will remain for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn
entirely by a rating agency if in its judgment circumstances in the future so warrant. None of us, our affiliates, the sponsor
or any of the sponsor&rsquo;s affiliates will have any obligation to replace or supplement the credit enhancement, or to take any

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-indent: 0.25in">Changes in payment patterns, finance charge
rates and credit card usage result from a variety of economic and social factors. Economic factors include, among others, the rate
of inflation, unemployment levels, the availability and cost of credit (including mortgages) and real estate values. Social factors
include, among others, consumer and business confidence levels and the public&rsquo;s attitude about incurring debt and the stigma
of personal bankruptcy. In addition, acts of terrorism or natural disasters in the United States and the political and/or military
response to any such events or the commencement of hostilities between the United States and a foreign nation or nations may have
an adverse effect on general economic conditions, consumer and business confidence and general market liquidity.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-indent: 0.25in">Key macroeconomic conditions historically have
affected the performance of the bank&rsquo;s credit card portfolio and the Company&rsquo;s business, results of operations and
financial condition and are likely to affect them in the future. Consumer confidence, unemployment and housing indicators are among
the factors that often impact consumer spending behavior and demand for credit. Poor economic conditions reduce the usage of Synchrony
Bank&rsquo;s credit cards and other financing products and the average purchase amount of transactions on the credit cards, which
reduces the amount of principal collections and finance charge collections available to make payments on your notes and the rate
of creation of additional receivables in the accounts designated to the trust. Poor economic conditions also adversely affect the
ability and willingness of customers to pay amounts owed to us, increasing delinquencies, bankruptcies, charge-offs and allowances
for loan losses, and decreasing recoveries. The assessment of the Company&rsquo;s credit profile includes the evaluation of portfolio
mix and account maturation, as well as broader consumer trends, such as payment behavior and overall indebtedness. In 2018, the
trend of increases in the Company&rsquo;s net charge-off rates and allowance coverage continued, but at a more modest rate as compared
to what the Company experienced in 2017, and the Company&rsquo;s delinquency rate remained largely in line with 2017 rates, as
U.S unemployment rates continued to stabilize and the Company experienced the favorable effects from certain refinements to its
underwriting standards which it began to implement in the second half of 2016 and continued in 2017.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-indent: 0.25in">Economic growth in the United States can slow
due to higher unemployment rates, lower housing values, concerns about the level of U.S. government debt and fiscal actions that
may be taken to address this, as well as economic and political conditions in the U.S. and global markets. A prolonged period of
slow economic growth or a significant deterioration in economic conditions or broader consumer trends, including consumer indebtedness,
would likely affect consumer spending levels and the ability and willingness of customers to pay amounts owed on the trust accounts,
and could have a material adverse effect on the Company&rsquo;s business, key credit trends, results of operations and financial
condition, and could have a material adverse effect on the performance of the transferred receivables and your notes.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-indent: 0.25in">We cannot assure the creation of additional
receivables in the accounts designated to the trust or that any particular pattern of cardholder payments will occur. A significant
decline in the amount of new receivables generated could result in the occurrence of an early amortization event for one or more
series, classes or tranches of notes, including your notes. If an early amortization event occurs, you could receive payment of
principal sooner than expected. In addition, changes in finance charges can alter the monthly payment rates of cardholders. A significant
decrease in monthly payment rates could slow the return of principal during an amortization period. See &ldquo;<I>Maturity Considerations</I>.&rdquo;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-indent: 0.25in">The bank operates its private label and co-branded
credit card programs with various program partners under program agreements, some of which, if not extended, are scheduled to expire
while your notes are outstanding. Historically, there has been turnover in the bank&rsquo;s program partners, and the bank expects
that this will continue in the future. For example, during the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company announced that it would
not be renewing the Retail Card program agreement with Walmart.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-indent: 0.25in">There is significant competition for the bank&rsquo;s
existing program partners, and its failure to retain its existing larger partner relationships upon the expiration of a relationship
or its earlier loss of a relationship upon the exercise of a program partner&rsquo;s early termination rights as described below
could have a material adverse effect on the bank&rsquo;s results of operation and financial condition to the extent it does not
acquire new program partners of similar size and profitability or otherwise grow its business. Such a failure could have an adverse
effect on the volume of receivables in the trust. The bank expects to have significant concentration in its largest relationships
for the foreseeable future.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-indent: 0.25in">The program agreements typically have contract
terms ranging from approximately five to ten years. Some of those program agreements provide that, upon expiration or termination,
the program partner may purchase or designate a third party to purchase the receivables generated with respect to its program,
including the receivables in the trust. Zero percent (0%) of the accounts would be subject to removal from the trust and 0% of
the total receivables in the trust as of January 31, 2019 would be subject to the related program partner&rsquo;s purchase right
prior to the scheduled principal payment date for your notes if the related program agreements were not extended.</P>

permit the program partners or the bank to terminate the program agreements prior to the respective termination dates for the programs
if the other party materially breaches its obligations under the related program agreements, subject to any cure rights under the
related program agreements. Certain program agreements are also subject to early termination in the event the related program partner
becomes insolvent, becomes subject to a bankruptcy proceeding or has a material change in financial condition, upon the occurrence
of a significant change in law or upon the occurrence of other specified portfolio-related performance triggers or other events

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-indent: 0.25in">The bank&rsquo;s ability to generate new receivables
and the finance charges and fees and other income associated with them is dependent upon sales of merchandise and services by its
program partners. The retail industry in which the bank&rsquo;s program partners operate is intensely competitive. The bank&rsquo;s
program partners compete with retailers and department stores in their own geographic areas, as well as catalog and internet sales
businesses. The bank&rsquo;s program partners&rsquo; sales may decrease or may not increase as we anticipate for various reasons,
some of which are in the program partners&rsquo; control and some of which are not. For example, retailer sales may be adversely
affected by macroeconomic conditions having a national, regional or more local effect on consumer spending, business conditions
affecting the general retail environment or a particular program partner or industry, or catastrophes affecting broad or more discrete
geographic areas. If the bank&rsquo;s program partners&rsquo; sales decline for any reason, it generally results in lower credit
sales, and therefore lower receivables volume and associated interest and fees and other income for the bank from their customers.
In addition, if a program partner closes some or all of its stores or becomes subject to a voluntary or involuntary bankruptcy
proceeding (or if there is a perception that it may become subject to a bankruptcy proceeding), its customers who have used the
bank&rsquo;s financing products may have less incentive to pay their outstanding balances to the bank, which could result in higher
charge-off rates than anticipated and the bank&rsquo;s costs for servicing its customers&rsquo; accounts may increase. This risk
is particularly acute with respect to the bank&rsquo;s largest program partners. Moreover, if the financial condition of a program
partner deteriorates significantly or a program partner becomes subject to a bankruptcy proceeding, the bank may not be able to
recover for customer returns, customer payments made in program partner stores or other amounts due to the bank from the program
partner. A decrease in sales by the bank&rsquo;s program partners for any reason or a bankruptcy proceeding involving any of them
could have a material adverse impact on the Company&rsquo;s business and the ability of the bank to originate additional receivables
to be transferred to the issuing entity. See &ldquo;&mdash;<I>The bank may not be able to designate new accounts to the trust when
required by the transaction documents</I>.&rdquo;</P>

are intensely competitive. Generally, the program partners compete not only with other retailers and department stores in the geographic
areas in which they operate, but also with numerous other types of retail outlets, including catalog and internet sales businesses.
We cannot assure you that the program partners will continue to generate receivables at the same rate as in prior years. Also,

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-indent: 0.25in">Economic growth in the United States can slow
due to higher unemployment rates, lower housing values, concerns about the level of U.S. government debt and fiscal actions that
may be taken to address this, as well as economic and political conditions in the global markets. A prolonged period of slow economic
growth or a significant deterioration in economic conditions would likely affect consumer spending levels and may increase the
risk that a program partner becomes subject to a voluntary or involuntary case under any applicable federal or state bankruptcy
or other similar law. The bankruptcy of a program partner could lead to a significant decline in the amount of new receivables
and could lead to increased delinquencies and defaults on the receivables associated with a program partner that is subject to
a proceeding under bankruptcy or similar laws. Any of these effects of a program partner bankruptcy could result in the occurrence
of an early amortization event for one or more series, classes or tranches of notes, including your notes, particularly if such
an event were to occur with respect to a program partner relating to a large percentage of the trust assets. The largest program
partner programs included in the trust portfolio are disclosed in &ldquo;<I>Composition of the Trust Portfolio&mdash;Composition

of principal sooner than expected. See &ldquo;<I>Maturity Considerations</I>.&rdquo;</P>

is also dependent upon its ability to compete in the current industry environment. The bank&rsquo;s program partners generally
accept most major credit cards and various other forms of payment, and therefore the bank&rsquo;s success depends on their active
and effective promotion of its products to their customers. The bank depends on its program partners to integrate the use of its
credit products into their store culture by training their sales associates about the bank&rsquo;s products, having their sales
associates encourage their customers to apply for, and use, the bank&rsquo;s products and otherwise effectively marketing the bank&rsquo;s
products. Program partners may also implement or fail to implement changes in their systems and technologies that may disrupt the
integration between their systems and technologies and the bank&rsquo;s systems, which could disrupt the use of the bank&rsquo;s
products. The failure by the bank&rsquo;s program partners to effectively promote and support its products as well as changes they
may make in their business models that negatively impact card usage could have a material adverse effect on the Company&rsquo;s
business and results of operations, and the rate at which new receivables are created. In addition, if program partners engage
in improper business practices, do not adhere to the terms of the program agreements or other contractual arrangements or standards,

banks providing undrawn committed capacity under the Company&rsquo;s securitization programs, these costs are likely to be passed
on to the Company. &nbsp;In addition, in response to Basel III, some banks in the market (including certain of the private lenders
in the Company&rsquo;s securitization programs) have added provisions to their credit agreements permitting them to delay disbursement
of funding requests for 30 days or more. If the bank lenders require delayed disbursements of funding provisions and/or higher
pricing for committing undrawn capacity to the bank, the bank&rsquo;s cost of funding and access to liquidity could be adversely

companies. In the future, the Company expects its products may face increased competition from new emerging payment technologies,
such as Apple Pay, Android Pay, Chase Pay, Samsung Pay and Square, to the extent that the Company&rsquo;s products are not, or
do not continue to be, accepted in, or compatible with, such technologies. The Company may also face increased competition from
current competitors or others who introduce or embrace disruptive technology that significantly changes the consumer credit and
payment industry. The Company competes for customers and their usage of the Company&rsquo;s products, and to minimize transfers
to competitors of customers&rsquo; outstanding balances, based on a number of factors, including pricing (interest rates and fees),
product offerings, credit limits, incentives (including loyalty programs) and customer service. Although the Company offers a variety
of consumer credit products, some of its competitors provide a broader selection of services, including home and automobile loans,
debit cards and bank branch ATM access, which may position them better among customers who prefer to use a single financial institution
to meet all of their financial needs. Some of the Company&rsquo;s competitors are substantially larger than the Company, which
may give those competitors advantages, including a more diversified product and customer base, the ability to reach out to more
customers and potential customers, operational efficiencies, more versatile technology platforms, broad-based local distribution
capabilities and lower-cost funding. In addition, some of the Company&rsquo;s competitors, including new and emerging competitors
in the digital and mobile payments space, are not subject to the same regulatory requirements or legislative scrutiny to which
the Company is subject, which also could place the Company at a competitive disadvantage. Customer attrition from any or all of
the Company&rsquo;s credit products or any lowering of the pricing of the Company&rsquo;s products by reducing interest rates or
fees in order to retain customers could reduce the Company&rsquo;s revenues and therefore the Company&rsquo;s earnings, as well
as reduce collections available to make payments on the offered notes and the creation of additional receivables in the accounts
designated to the trust.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-indent: 0.25in">The Company is subject to the risk of fraudulent
activity associated with its program partners, customers and third parties handling customer information. While the Company&rsquo;s
fraud-related operational losses stabilized in 2016, they have increased significantly in recent years. The Company&rsquo;s fraud-related
losses have shifted away from counterfeit fraud losses with the implementation of the EMV chip in dual cards and general purpose
co-branded credit cards and towards application fraud and commerce fraud (including as a result of well-publicized security breaches
at retailers unrelated to the Company). The Company&rsquo;s products are susceptible to application fraud, because among other
things, it provides immediate access to the credit line at the time of approval. In addition, sales on the internet and through
mobile channels are becoming a larger part of the Company&rsquo;s business and fraudulent activity is higher as a percentage of
sales in those channels than in stores. The Company&rsquo;s products are susceptible to different types of fraud, and, depending
on the Company&rsquo;s product channel mix (including as a result of the introduction, if any, of a Synchrony-branded general purpose
credit card), the Company may continue to experience variations in, or levels of, fraud-related expense that are different from
or higher than that experienced by some of the Company&rsquo;s competitors or the industry generally.</P>

the financial services industry in general, and credit card fraud, identity theft and related crimes are likely to continue to
be prevalent, and perpetrators are growing more sophisticated. The Company&rsquo;s resources, technologies and fraud prevention
tools may be insufficient to accurately detect and prevent fraud. High profile fraudulent activity also could negatively impact
the Company&rsquo;s brand and reputation, which could negatively impact the use of the Company&rsquo;s cards and thereby have a
material adverse effect on the Company&rsquo;s results of operations and the bank&rsquo;s ability to originate receivables. In
addition, significant increases in fraudulent activity could lead to regulatory intervention (such as increased customer notification
requirements), which could increase the Company&rsquo;s costs and also negatively impact the Company&rsquo;s operating results,
brand and reputation and could lead the Company to take steps to reduce fraud risk, which could increase the Company&rsquo;s costs.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-indent: 0.25in">Information security risks for large financial
institutions like the Company have increased recently in part because of new technologies, the use of the internet and telecommunications
technologies (including mobile and other connected devices) to conduct financial and other business transactions and the increased
sophistication and activities of organized crime, perpetrators of fraud, hackers, terrorists and others. In addition to cyber-attacks
or other security breaches involving the theft of sensitive and confidential information, hackers recently have engaged in attacks
against large financial institutions that are designed to disrupt key business services, such as consumer-facing web sites. The
Company&rsquo;s business performance and marketing efforts may increase the Company&rsquo;s profile and therefore its risk of being
targeted for cyber-attacks and other security breaches, including attacks targeting its key business services, websites, executives
and partners. The Company is not able to anticipate or implement effective preventive measures against all security breaches of
these types, especially because the techniques used change frequently and because attacks can originate from a wide variety of
sources. The Company employs detection and response mechanisms designed to contain and mitigate security incidents, but early detection
may be thwarted by sophisticated attacks and malware designed to avoid detection.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-indent: 0.25in">The Company also faces risks related to cyber-attacks
and other security breaches in connection with credit card and deposit transactions that typically involve the transmission of
sensitive information regarding its customers through various third-parties, including its program partners, retailers that are
not the Company&rsquo;s partners where the Company&rsquo;s dual cards and general purpose co-branded credit cards are used, merchant
acquiring banks, payment processors, card networks (e.g., Visa and Mastercard) and its processors (e.g., First Data Corporation
(&ldquo;<B>First Data</B>&rdquo;) and Fiserv, Inc. (&ldquo;<B>Fiserv</B>&rdquo;)). Some of these parties have in the past been
the target of security breaches and cyber-attacks, and because the transactions involve third parties and environments such as
the point of sale that the Company does not control or secure, future security breaches or cyber-attacks affecting any of these
third-parties could impact the Company through no fault of its own and in some cases, the Company may have exposure and suffer
losses for breaches or attacks relating to them. The Company also relies on numerous other third-party service providers to conduct
other aspects of its business operations and faces similar risks relating to them. While the Company regularly conducts security
assessments of significant third-party service providers, the Company cannot be sure that their information security protocols
are sufficient to withstand a cyber-attack or other security breach.</P>

vendors, are the sole source or one of a limited number of sources of the services they provide for the Company. In January 2019,
Fiserv announced that it had agreed to acquire First Data. It would be difficult and disruptive for the Company to replace some
of its third-party vendors, particularly First Data and Fiserv, in a timely manner if they were unwilling or unable to provide
the Company with these services in the future (as a result of their financial or business conditions or otherwise), and the Company&rsquo;s

These changes may also require the Company to invest significant management attention and resources to make any necessary changes

to time, the Company has been named as a defendant in various legal actions, including arbitrations, class actions and other litigation,
arising in connection with its business activities. Certain of the legal actions include claims for substantial compensatory and/or
punitive damages, or claims for indeterminate amounts of damages. In addition, while historically the arbitration provision in
the Company&rsquo;s customer agreements generally has limited the Company&rsquo;s exposure to consumer class action litigation,
there can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in enforcing the arbitration clause in the future. There may also
be legislative or other efforts to directly or indirectly prohibit the use of pre-dispute arbitration clauses, or the Company may
be compelled as a result of competitive pressure or reputational concerns to voluntarily eliminate pre-dispute arbitration clauses.
If the arbitration provision is not enforceable or eliminated (for whatever reason), the Company&rsquo;s exposure to class action
litigation could increase significantly.</P>

the trust could likewise be subject to the risks of litigation and regulatory actions discussed above. In particular, the United
States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, <I>Madden v. Midland Funding, LLC</I> (No. 14-2131-cv, 2015 WL 2435657), created
some level of uncertainty as to whether non-bank entities purchasing loans originated by a bank may rely on federal preemption
of state usury laws, and such decision may create an increased risk of litigation by plaintiffs challenging the trust&rsquo;s ability
to collect interest in accordance with the account terms of certain receivables. In <I>Madden</I>, the Second Circuit concluded
that a non-bank assignee of a loan originated by a national bank is not entitled to rely on the National Bank Act&rsquo;s preemption
of state usury laws. The U.S. Supreme Court denied the petition for certiorari filed by Midland Funding, LLC, and the case was
remanded to the district court.</P>

obligations to change its business practices or other requirements resulting in increased expenses, diminished earnings and damage
to its reputation. The current environment of additional regulation, increased regulatory compliance efforts and enhanced regulatory
enforcement has resulted in significant operational and compliance costs and may prevent or make it less attractive for the bank
to continue providing certain products and services. There is no assurance that these regulatory matters or other factors will
not, in the future, affect how the bank conducts its business and in turn have a material adverse effect on the Company&rsquo;s
business, results of operations and financial condition. Any such regulatory matters may also cause the transferred receivables
to be unenforceable, give rise to defenses to payments by the obligors on the transferred receivables or require the bank to make
downward adjustments on the transferred receivables, resulting in reductions in the aggregate principal balance of the transferred
receivables in the trust portfolio and/or a reduction in the related finance charges, either of which may cause an early amortization

review any references to or requirements regarding credit ratings in its regulations, remove those references or requirements and
substitute other appropriate standards of creditworthiness in place of the credit ratings, and undertake a number of rulemakings
related to the asset-backed securities market. One aspect of these rulemaking efforts will involve a review by the SEC of certain
exclusions and exemptions that allow asset-backed issuers to avoid being regulated as investment companies under the Investment
Company Act of 1940, as amended (the &ldquo;<B>Investment Company Act</B>&rdquo;). The SEC has issued an advance notice of proposed
rulemaking indicating that it is considering proposed amendments to these exclusions and exemptions under the Investment Company
Act and requesting comment as to the scope and content of any future amendment proposal. If the SEC were to narrow or eliminate
the exclusions and exemptions under the Investment Company Act that are currently available to the issuing entity, or were to impose
additional conditions for relying on such exclusions and exemptions, the issuing entity could be required to stop issuing asset-backed
securities or could be required to comply with additional conditions that could affect the notes issued by the issuing entity.
If any future amendment adopted by the SEC were to cause the issuing entity to be subject to regulation as an investment company,
an early amortization event would occur for the notes. The effects of the SEC&rsquo;s review of the Investment Company Act and

can be given that future rulemakings will not have a significant impact on the issuing entity, including on the amount of notes

could be negatively impacted by them. For example, in the United States, certain of the Company&rsquo;s businesses are subject
to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (&ldquo;<B>GLBA</B>&rdquo;) and implementing regulations and guidance. Among other things, the GLBA:
(i)&nbsp;imposes certain limitations on the ability of financial institutions to share consumers&rsquo; nonpublic personal information
with nonaffiliated third parties, (ii)&nbsp;requires that financial institutions provide certain disclosures to consumers about
their information collection, sharing and security practices and affords customers the right to &ldquo;opt out&rdquo; of the institution&rsquo;s
disclosure of their personal financial information to nonaffiliated third parties (with certain exceptions) and (iii)&nbsp;requires
financial institutions to develop, implement and maintain a written comprehensive information security program containing safeguards

activities, and the sensitivity of customer information processed by the financial institution as well as plans for responding

regulatory agencies, states and foreign jurisdictions have enacted data security breach notification requirements with varying
levels of individual, consumer, regulatory and/or law enforcement notification in certain circumstances in the event of a security
breach. Many of these requirements also apply broadly to the retailers that accept the Company&rsquo;s cards. In many countries
that have yet to impose data security breach notification requirements, regulators have increasingly used the threat of significant
sanctions and penalties by data protection authorities to encourage voluntary notification and discourage data security breaches.</P>

information, and some of its current or planned business activities. This could also increase the Company&rsquo;s costs of compliance
and business operations and could reduce income from certain business initiatives. In the United States, this includes increased
privacy-related enforcement activity at the federal level, by the Federal Trade Commission, as well as at the state level, such
as with regard to mobile applications, and state legislation such as the California Consumer Privacy Act, which could increase
the Company&rsquo;s costs. In the European Union, this includes the General Data Protection Regulation.</P>

three sales platforms: Retail Card, Payment Solutions and CareCredit. The accounts designated to the trust were originated under
the bank&rsquo;s Retail Card platform. Retail Card is a leading provider of private label credit cards, and also provides co-branded
cards (some of which are also referred to as dual cards, since they can combine features and benefits of private label credit cards
with multi-merchant acceptance of general purpose credit cards) and small and medium-sized business credit products. Private label
credit cards are program partner-branded credit cards that are used primarily for the purchase of goods and services from the program
participant or within the program network. The bank&rsquo;s patented dual cards are credit cards that function as a private label
credit card when used to purchase goods and services from the bank&rsquo;s program participants and as a general purpose credit
card when used elsewhere.</P>

credit card accounts. The private label credit card account business consists of revolving consumer credit account programs established
with program partners that have been approved by the bank. Open-end revolving credit card accounts are offered to customers of
those program partners. Each credit card account is established primarily for the purchase of goods and services of a particular
program partner. In addition, in some cases, cardholders may be permitted to access their credit card accounts for cash advances.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-indent: 0.25in">In certain cases, the bank, together with its
retail partners, have been replacing private label credit cards offered to their customers with co-branded Mastercard and Visa
general purpose credit cards that may be used to purchase goods and services wherever Mastercard and Visa cards, as the case may
be, are accepted, and the bank has the ability to issue co-branded cards for use on the American Express and Discover networks.
For many programs, the bank also offers such co-branded credit cards to new customers at the point of sale. Such co-branded cards
may in the future make up a larger or smaller portion of the bank&rsquo;s portfolio. The bank currently offers to originate co-branded
credit cards for several program partners including Sam&rsquo;s Club, JCPenney and Gap. The bank has previously offered co-branded
credit cards for other program partners including Lowe&rsquo;s, and may in the future offer co-branded credit cards for other program
partners. Certain holders of private label credit card accounts have been solicited to replace their private label credit cards
with co-branded credit cards. In the future the bank expects to solicit other holders of private label credit card accounts to
replace their private label credit cards with co-branded credit card accounts.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-indent: 0.25in">Generally, when a cardholder receives a co-branded
credit card as a replacement for its private label credit card, the cardholder will have up to approximately 120&nbsp;days, depending
on the applicable replacement process, to accept a co-branded credit card. If the cardholder does not accept a co-branded credit
card, its existing private label credit card account will remain open. In addition, in most cases, the co-branded credit cards
are offered at the point of sale at the same retail locations where private label credit cards are offered. When a cardholder&rsquo;s
private label credit card that is currently designated to the trust is replaced by a co-branded credit card, the private label
credit card account will be removed from the trust in accordance with the provisions of the securitization documents. The balance,
if any, on the private label credit card that is replaced by a co-branded credit card will be reduced to zero and in connection
therewith the balance will be transferred to the successor co-branded credit card account.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-indent: 0.25in">The bank&rsquo;s co-branded cards are currently
offered in association with either the Mastercard or Visa network. Merchants that accept co-branded cards receive a portion of
the total purchase price reduced by an interchange fee imposed by the network, a portion of which is used to compensate card issuing
banks. Since the co-branded cards issued by the bank can be used for purchases through one of these systems, charges on those cards
will generate interchange revenue for the bank in connection with purchases by cardholders other than at the program partner related
to the co-branded card. When co-branded card accounts are designated as part of the trust portfolio, the bank transfers to us,
and we will in turn transfer to the trust, a portion of the interchange from accounts in the related program partner&rsquo;s co-branded
card program. The portion of interchange to be transferred is meant to approximate the interchange attributable to cardholder charges
for merchandise and services on the co-branded accounts that are designated to the trust portfolio. Interchange received by the
trust will be treated as collections of finance charge receivables.</P>

into a private label or co-branded credit card program, enter into a credit card program agreement with the bank. Our use of the
term &ldquo;program partners&rdquo; to refer to these entities is not intended to, and does not, describe the bank&rsquo;s legal
relationship with them, imply that a legal partnership or other relationship exists between the parties or create any legal partnership
or other relationship. The program agreements vary on a program partner-by-program partner basis, and may be amended from time

generated thereunder from the time of origination, unless otherwise sold following origination.</P>

of their termination dates, however there is no assurance that the bank and the program partners will mutually agree on any such
renewal.</P>

partners to terminate the agreement prior to the scheduled termination date for various reasons, including if the program partner
breaches its obligations. Some program agreements also permit the program partner to terminate the program if the bank fails to
meet certain service levels or changes certain key accountholder terms or credit criteria, if the bank fails to achieve certain
targets with respect to approvals of new customers as a result of the credit criteria it uses, if the bank elects not to increase
the program size when the outstanding receivables under the program reach certain thresholds or is not adequately capitalized,
or if certain force majeure events occur or certain changes in the bank&rsquo;s ownership occur. Certain of the program agreements
are also subject to early termination by a party if the other party has a material adverse change in its financial condition. Historically,

is screened for information such as applicant age or critical missing information which would result in a policy rejection of the

from one of the three major credit bureaus using industry and proprietary credit models. Applicants who are identified as having
a higher potential for fraud will go through an additional authentication process(es) before being approved. The bank also compares
applicants&rsquo; names against the Specially Designated Nationals list maintained by The Office of Foreign Assets Control (&ldquo;<B>OFAC</B>&rdquo;),
as well as screens that account for adherence to the USA PATRIOT Act and CARD Act requirements, including ability to pay requirements.

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-indent: 0.25in">When the bank enters into a new credit card
program agreement, it may acquire a portfolio of existing accounts and receivables that were originated by a predecessor under
a prior program with the same program partner (or in certain circumstances, originated by the program partner itself). In such
cases, the bank evaluates the portfolio of accounts and receivables that may accompany the program partnership in the context of
the broader terms of the transaction to determine whether to acquire some or all of the pre-existing accounts and receivables.
In those instances when the bank does elect to acquire accounts and receivables originated by a predecessor, the bank manages the

Regardless of the channel through which a credit account is originated, in making the initial credit approval decision to open
a credit account or otherwise grant credit, the bank follows a series of credit risk and underwriting procedures. In most cases,
when applications are made in-store or by internet or mobile, the process is fully automated and applicants are notified of the
bank&rsquo;s credit decision immediately. The bank generally obtains certain information provided by the applicant and obtains
a credit bureau report from one of the major credit bureaus. The credit report information the bank obtains is electronically transmitted
and translated into industry scoring models and the bank&rsquo;s proprietary scoring models developed to calculate a credit score.
The credit management team determines in advance the qualifying credit scores and initial credit line assignments for each portfolio
and product type. The bank periodically analyzes performance trends of accounts originated at different score levels as compared
to projected performance, and adjusts the minimum score or the opening credit limit to manage risk. Different scoring models may
be used depending upon bureau type and account source.</P>

to ensure the portfolio satisfies its credit risk guidelines. As part of this review, the bank receives data on the third-party
accounts and loans, which allows the bank to assess the portfolio on the basis of certain core characteristics, such as historical
performance of the assets and distributions of credit and loss information. In addition, the bank benchmarks potential portfolio
acquisitions against its existing programs to assess relative current and projected risks. Finally, the bank&rsquo;s credit management
team must approve the acquisition, taking into account the results of its risk assessment process. Once assets are migrated to
the bank&rsquo;s systems, the bank&rsquo;s account management protocols will apply immediately as described in &ldquo;&mdash;<I>Customer

to the customer&rsquo;s broader credit performance. To monitor and control the quality of the bank&rsquo;s loan portfolio (including
the portion of the portfolio originated by third parties), the bank uses behavioral scoring models that the bank has developed
to score each active account on its monthly cycle date. Proprietary risk models, together with credit scores obtained on each active
account no less than quarterly, are an integral part of the bank&rsquo;s credit decision-making process. Depending on the duration
of the customer&rsquo;s account, risk profile and other performance metrics, the account may be subject to a range of account actions,
including limits on transaction authorization and increases or decreases in purchase and cash credit limits.</P>

an ongoing lifecycle marketing program, the primary purpose of which is to promote cardholders&rsquo; loyalty to the program partners.
Working in close collaboration with each program partner, the bank develops card marketing programs that promote program partners&rsquo;
cardholder sales for creditworthy cardholders. Direct mail, email and monthly billing statement messages and inserts provide direct
marketing communications for cardholders. This supports the program partner&rsquo;s in-store programs by encouraging both store
traffic and card usage. These programs include promotional financing offers, cardholder events, product discounts, dollar-off certificates,
accountholder sales, reward points and offerings, new product announcements and previews and free or reduced cost gift wrapping,
alteration or delivery services.</P>

management and data analytics teams, the bank tracks cardholder responsiveness to marketing programs and uses this research to
target marketing messages and promotional offers to cardholders based on their individual characteristics, such as length of relationship
and spending pattern. For example, if a cardholder responds positively to a coupon sent by email message, the bank will tailor
future marketing messages so that they are delivered by email message. The bank&rsquo;s ability to target marketing messages and
promotions is enhanced for co-branded programs because the bank receives, collects and analyzes data on in-store and other spending.</P>

loyalty programs as part of the private label and co-branded credit card benefits offered to specific program partners. These programs
typically provide cardholders with rewards in the form of merchandise discounts that are earned based on achieving a pre-set spending
level on the card. The merchandise discounts can be mailed to the cardholder, accessed online or may be immediately redeemable
at the program partner&rsquo;s store. Other programs provide cash back or reward points, which are redeemable for a variety of
products or awards. These loyalty programs are designed to generate incremental purchase volume per customer, while reinforcing
the value of the card to the customer and strengthening customer loyalty.</P>

rules of Regulation RR issued by the SEC, either we, as depositor and a wholly-owned affiliate (as defined in Regulation RR) of
the bank, or the bank, as sponsor, is required to retain an economic interest in the credit risk of the transferred receivables.
We intend to satisfy the risk retention requirements by maintaining a seller&rsquo;s interest, calculated in accordance with Regulation
RR, <I>plus</I> funds on deposit in the excess funding account in a minimum amount not less than five percent of the aggregate
unpaid principal balance of all outstanding notes issued by the trust, other than any notes that are at all times held by the bank
or one or more wholly-owned affiliates of the bank and designated as risk retention retained notes pursuant to the related indenture
supplement (which we refer to as the &ldquo;adjusted outstanding ABS investor interests&rdquo; in this section). For purpose of
the calculation described in the preceding sentence, a wholly-owned affiliate of the bank will include any person, other than the
issuing entity, that directly or indirectly, wholly controls (i.e. owns 100% of the equity in such person), is wholly controlled
by, or is wholly under common control with, the bank.</P>

&ldquo;<I>The Trust&mdash;Capitalization of Trust; Minimum Free Equity Amount</I>&rdquo; in this prospectus. As of the closing
date following the issuance of the offered notes, we expect to have a seller&rsquo;s interest equal to at least $2,025,139,042.45,
which will equal 62.03% of the adjusted outstanding ABS investor interests. For the purposes of determining the seller&rsquo;s
interest on the closing date, we have used the aggregate amount of principal receivables as of January 31, 2019, and the outstanding
principal balance of the notes expected to be outstanding as of the closing date, including $750,000,000 of offered notes. We will
disclose within a reasonable time after the closing date the amount of the seller&rsquo;s interest on the closing date if materially
different from that disclosed in this prospectus. In addition, we will disclose on each monthly Form 10-D the amount of the seller&rsquo;s
interest as of each monthly measurement described below.</P>

cause the seller&rsquo;s interest <I>plus</I> amounts on deposit in the excess funding account to be at least five percent of the

when it is appointed as receiver or conservator (and references in this section to the FDIC are in its capacity as such). To qualify
for a safe harbor, the securitization or participation must satisfy the preconditions specified for that type of transaction. If
one or more of these preconditions are not met, the limitations imposed by the FDIC on the FDIC&rsquo;s powers would not apply.
The relevant safe harbor for the trust will be the safe harbor for securitizations that do not satisfy the conditions for sale

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-indent: 0.25in">If the FDIC is appointed as conservator or
receiver for an insured depository institution that has effected a securitization that complies with the safe harbor, the FDIC
as conservator or receiver may seek to repudiate the securitization agreement pursuant to which the financial assets were transferred.
In such event, the FDIC will be obligated to either pay damages as described in the following sentence within 10 business days
following the effective date of the notice of repudiation or consent to the exercise of any contractual rights in accordance with
the documents governing the securitization, including taking possession of the financial assets, provided that no involvement of
the receiver or conservator is required other than such consents, waivers or execution of transfer documents as may be reasonably
requested in the ordinary course of business in order to facilitate the exercise of such contractual rights. For purposes of the
preceding sentence, the amount of damages due from the FDIC would be equal to the par value of the notes outstanding on the date
of appointment of the FDIC as conservator or receiver, less any payments of principal received by the noteholders through the date
of repudiation, <I>plus </I>unpaid, accrued interest through the date of repudiation in accordance with the transaction documents
to the extent actually received through collections received through the date of repudiation. The FDIC Rule provides that &ldquo;[u]pon
payment of such repudiation damages, all liens or claims on the financial assets created pursuant to the securitization documents
shall be released.&rdquo;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-indent: 0.25in">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-indent: 0.25in">Damages paid by the FDIC will be distributed
to noteholders on the earlier of (1) the next payment date on which such damages could be distributed and (2) the earliest practicable
date that the indenture trustee could declare a special payment date, subject to applicable provisions of the indenture, applicable
law and the procedures of any applicable clearing agency. If the date on which damages are to be distributed to noteholders is
not a regular payment date, then the amount of interest payable to the noteholders will be prorated to such date. Because the damages
payable by the FDIC would only include interest through the date of repudiation, the amount of damages received by noteholders
would not be sufficient to pay interest on the notes during the period after the FDIC gives notice of repudiation and prior to
the payment date on which damages are distributed to noteholders. The FDIC may assert that the release of all liens and claims
on the financial assets that occurs upon payment of the repudiation damages would include a release of the indenture trustee&rsquo;s
lien on cash held in the trust accounts, including collections on the financial assets prior to the date of repudiation. In such
event, the funds on deposit in the trust accounts may not be available to pay interest on the notes, to the extent such interest
is not included in the repudiation damages, and noteholders may suffer a shortfall in the payment of interest.</P>

harbor to make) payments to the investors to the extent actually received through payments on the financial assets, but in the
case of repudiation, only to the extent received through the date of notice of repudiation is given, in accordance with the securitization
documents. In addition, subject to the FDIC&rsquo;s right to repudiate such agreements, the FDIC consents in the safe harbor to

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-indent: 0in">OLA differ from those of the United States bankruptcy
code in several respects. To address some of these differences, the FDIC in July of 2011 adopted a regulation confirming that the
treatment under the OLA of preferential transfers is intended to be consistent with similar provisions in, and doctrines developed
under, the United States bankruptcy code. In addition, because the legislation remains subject to clarification through FDIC regulations
and has yet to be applied by the FDIC in any receivership, it is unclear exactly what impact these provisions will have on any
particular company, including Synchrony, us or the issuing entity, or its creditors.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-indent: 0.25in">There is uncertainty about which companies
will be subject to the OLA rather than the bankruptcy code. For a company to become subject to the OLA, the Secretary of the Treasury
(in consultation with the President of the United States) must determine, among other things, that the company is in default or
in danger of default, the failure of such company and its resolution under the bankruptcy code would have serious adverse effects
on financial stability in the United States, no viable private sector alternative is available to prevent the default of the company
and an OLA proceeding would mitigate these adverse effects. We and the issuing entity could also potentially be subject to the
provisions of the OLA as &ldquo;covered subsidiaries&rdquo; of Synchrony. For us or the issuing entity to be subject to receivership
under the OLA (1) the FDIC would have to be appointed as receiver for Synchrony under the OLA and (2) the FDIC and the Secretary
of the Treasury would have to jointly determine that (a) we or the issuing entity, as applicable, were in default or in danger
of default, (b) the liquidation of that covered subsidiary would avoid or mitigate serious adverse effects on the financial stability
or economic conditions of the United States and (c) such appointment would facilitate the orderly liquidation of Synchrony.</P>

contract was burdensome, and that repudiation would promote the orderly administration of Synchrony&rsquo;s affairs, our affairs
or the issuing entity&rsquo;s affairs, as applicable. Among the contracts that might be repudiated are the receivables sale agreement,

of the opinion that the FDIC as receiver for a covered financial company, which could include Synchrony or its subsidiaries (including
us and the issuing entity), cannot repudiate a contract or lease unless it has been appointed as receiver for an entity that is
party to the contract or lease or the separate existence of that entity may be disregarded under other applicable law. In addition,

FDIC will not, in the exercise of its authority under Section 210(c) of the Dodd-Frank Act, reclaim, recover, or recharacterize
as property of that covered financial company or the receivership assets transferred by that covered financial company prior to
the end of the applicable transition period of a regulation provided that such transfer satisfies the conditions for the exclusion
of such assets from the property of the estate of that covered financial company under the United States bankruptcy code. Although
this advisory opinion does not bind the FDIC or its Board of Directors, and could be modified or withdrawn in the future, the advisory
opinion also states that the Acting General Counsel will recommend that the FDIC Board of Directors incorporate a transition period
of 90 days for any provisions in any further regulations affecting the statutory power to disaffirm or repudiate contracts. The
foregoing Acting General Counsel&rsquo;s interpretation applies to all notes issued by revolving trusts or master trusts prior
to the end of the applicable transition period. To the extent any future regulations or subsequent FDIC actions in an OLA proceeding
involving Synchrony or its subsidiaries (including us and the issuing entity) are contrary to this advisory opinion, payment or
distributions of principal and interest on the notes issued by the trust could be delayed or reduced.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-indent: 0.25in">In addition, if we were to become subject to
the OLA as a covered financial company, the FDIC as receiver could assert that we still effectively own the transferred receivables
and that the issuing entity should be treated as having made a loan to us secured by the transferred receivables. The FDIC ordinarily
has the power to repudiate secured loans and then recover the collateral after paying damages, as described further below, to the
lenders. If the FDIC repudiated that loan, the amount of compensation that the FDIC would be required to pay would be limited to
&ldquo;actual direct compensatory damages&rdquo; determined as of the date of the FDIC&rsquo;s appointment as receiver. There is
no general statutory definition of &ldquo;actual direct compensatory damages&rdquo; in this context, but the term does not include
damages for lost profits or opportunity. However, under the OLA, in the case of any debt for borrowed money, actual direct compensatory
damages is no less than the amount lent <I>plus </I>accrued interest <I>plus</I> any accreted original issue discount as of the
date the FDIC was appointed receiver and, to the extent that an allowed secured claim is secured by property the value of which
is greater than the amount of such claim and any accrued interest through the date of repudiation or disaffirmance, such accrued
interest.</P>

agencies and attorneys. As of January 31, 2019, Synchrony&rsquo;s internal collection departments included&nbsp;several collection
sites with approximately 1,017 full-time equivalent frontline collectors and approximately 61 full-time equivalent managers. Synchrony&rsquo;s

past due, collection efforts generally begin one day after the billing date. Typically, no more than five attempts to contact the
obligor on an account will be made per day until contact is made. If a cardholder promises to pay, 10 days is the longest time
period between attempts to contact the cardholder. Collection efforts are based upon customer account characteristics. These characteristics
include the cardholder&rsquo;s payment history and delinquency status, and whether the account was a first payment default. These
characteristics are analyzed to determine the optimal collection strategy, which could include scheduling an account to receive
a telephone call, a letter or e-mail, a 2Way Connect call (interactive voice response), or no action at the present time. The Company
uses several collection strategy tools and related software packages to automate the collection process in addition to a standardized
automated daily calling procedure that maximizes its opportunity to contact the cardholder. In addition, a collection website offers
delinquent cardholders self-serve options to resolve their delinquency.</P>

against Citibank in the Supreme Court of the State of New York by a group of investors in 48 private-label RMBS trusts for which
Citibank allegedly serves or did serve as trustee, asserting claims for purported violations of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939
(the &ldquo;<B>Trust Indenture Act</B>&rdquo;), breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty and negligence based on Citibank&rsquo;s
alleged failure to perform its duties as trustee for the 48 RMBS trusts. On November 24, 2014, plaintiffs sought leave to withdraw
this action. On the same day, a smaller subset of similar plaintiff investors in 27 private-label RMBS trusts for which Citibank
allegedly serves or did serve as trustee, filed a new civil action against Citibank in the United States District Court for the
Southern District of New York asserting similar claims as the prior action filed in state court. In January 2015, the court closed
plaintiffs&rsquo; original state court action. On September 8, 2015, the federal court dismissed all claims as to 24 of the 27
trusts and allowed certain of the claims to proceed as to the other three trusts. Subsequently, plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed
all claims with respect to two of the three trusts. On April 7, 2017, Citibank filed a motion for summary judgment. Plaintiffs
filed its consolidated opposition brief and cross motion for partial summary judgment on May 22, 2017. Briefing on those motions
was completed on August 4, 2017. On March 22, 2018, the court granted Citibank&rsquo;s motion for summary judgment in its entirety,
denied Plaintiffs&rsquo; motion for summary judgment and ordered the clerk to close the case. On April 20, 2018, plaintiffs filed
a notice of appeal. Plaintiffs&rsquo; opening brief was filed on August 3, 2018. Citibank filed its opposition on November 2, 2018.

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-indent: 0.25in">The relationship between the bank and its customers
is regulated under federal and state consumer protection laws. With respect to credit accounts issued by the bank, the most significant
federal laws include the federal Truth in Lending Act, Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the FCRA, Fair Debt Collection Practices Act
and the GLBA. These and other federal laws and regulations, among other things, require the disclosure of the cost of credit, provide
substantive consumer rights, prohibit discrimination in credit transactions, regulate the use of credit report information, provide
financial privacy protections, require safe and sound banking operations, prohibit unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices,
restrict the bank&rsquo;s ability to raise interest rates, and subject the bank to substantial regulatory oversight. State, and
in some cases, local laws also may regulate the relationship between the bank and its U.S. customers in these areas, as well as
in the areas of collection practices, and may provide other additional consumer protections. Moreover, the bank is subject to the
Servicemembers Civil Relief Act, which protects persons on active military service and their dependents from undue hardship resulting
from their military service. The Servicemembers Civil Relief Act applies to all debts incurred prior to the commencement of active
duty (including credit card and other open-end credit) and limits the amount of interest including service and renewal charges
and any other fees or charges (other than bona fide insurance) that is related to the obligation or liability. The bank&rsquo;s
credit card programs are also subject to the MLA, which extends specific protections to covered borrowers. These protections include,
but are not limited to: a limit on the military annual percentage rate that can be charged to 36%, delivery of certain required
disclosures and a prohibition on mandatory arbitration agreements. See &ldquo;<I>Risk Factors&mdash;The Company&rsquo;s business
is subject to government regulation, supervision, examination and enforcement, which could adversely affect the Company&rsquo;s
business, results of operations and financial condition.</I>&rdquo;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-indent: 0.25in">The CARD Act was enacted in 2009 and most of
the requirements became effective in 2010. The CARD Act made numerous amendments to the Truth in Lending Act, requiring the bank
to make significant changes to many of its business practices, including marketing, underwriting, pricing and billing. The CARD
Act&rsquo;s restrictions on the bank&rsquo;s ability to increase interest rates on existing balances to respond to market conditions
and credit risk ultimately constrain the bank&rsquo;s willingness to extend credit to new customers and provide additional credit
to current customers. Other CARD Act restrictions, such as limitations on late fees, have resulted and will continue to result
in reduced interest income and loan fee income.</P>

to prevent &ldquo;unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices&rdquo; and ensure consistent enforcement of laws so that all consumers
have access to markets for consumer financial products and services that are fair, transparent and competitive. The CFPB has rulemaking
and interpretive authority under the Dodd-Frank Act and other federal consumer financial services laws, as well as broad supervisory,

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-indent: 0.25in">In the past, legislation has been introduced
in Congress that would have required additional transparency to foster greater competition with respect to interchange fees. If
such legislation is introduced and passed, it could ultimately lead to direct government oversight and regulation of interchange
fees. In 2012, Visa Inc. and Mastercard Inc. entered into a settlement agreement with retailers regarding interchange fees, which
includes an agreement by the defendants to pay the retailers $6.05 billion, and to make association rule changes and give other
relief. The class settlement was approved by the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York on December
13, 2013. The National Retail Federation and a number of merchants appealed that settlement to the United States Court of Appeals
for the Second Circuit and on June 30, 2016, the Second Circuit reversed Judge Gleeson&rsquo;s ruling that approved the settlement
and remanded the action back to the Eastern District of New York. On November 23, 2016, the class plaintiffs petitioned the U.S.
Supreme Court for a writ of certiorari to review the Second Circuit&rsquo;s decision. The Supreme Court denied the petition on
March 27, 2017. Further, a number of merchants, including several large retailers, have elected to &ldquo;opt out&rdquo; of the
proposed settlement. Opting out allows these retailers to commence separate actions on these matters and some of these merchants
have already commenced new actions against Visa and Mastercard. On September 17, 2018, Visa Inc., Mastercard Inc. and certain consumer

preliminary approval of the Settlement Agreement but there is no assurance that final approval will be obtained. Any reduction
in the interchange fees paid by merchants to banks could adversely impact the business operations of credit card issuers and could

transferred to the bank&rsquo;s information systems including data architectural controls that validate record counts as well as
data quality controls to measure completeness, consistency and validity. In addition, the bank verifies the accuracy of what is

of the results. This notification to bank management may result in re-evaluating and, potentially, re-building models. &nbsp;When
monitoring the quality of the automated decision approvals, the bank uses monthly portfolio performance packages. These packages

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-indent: 0.25in">Since July 1, 2010, additional procedures have
been implemented to monitor the activities of the Credit Solutions group. Currently, on a monthly basis, a surveillance team screens
a sample of accounts that were handled by the Credit Solutions group to identify accounts for decisions outside the procedure.
The surveillance team selects the sample of accounts to be reviewed on a random basis in an amount sufficient to provide a 95%
confidence level for all accounts that were handled by the Credit Solutions group in the prior month. Such accounts are then re-evaluated
to determine whether there were any exceptions from underwriting guidelines with respect to the credit lines granted on such accounts.
Prior to March 1, 2018, the surveillance team screened all accounts that were handled by the Credit Solutions group, and there
may be modifications to such surveillance procedures from time to time in the future.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-indent: 0.25in">In connection with account additions, we periodically
identify accounts that meet the trust eligibility criteria by screening the inventory of accounts owned by the bank (including
accounts acquired from third party originators) for the applicable characteristics. We then prepare a report that shows the applicable
account characteristics for the accounts that passed the screen. This report is reviewed by the bank to ensure that the screen
properly excluded any ineligible accounts. Among the population of eligible accounts, the bank, in its discretion, may apply additional
screens based on certain account characteristics, including credit score and delinquency status, however, the bank is not required
to do so. Once these additional screens have been applied, the bank randomly selects accounts from the remaining population of
eligible accounts. In connection with each account addition, we will represent that no selection procedures believed to be materially
adverse to the interests of the issuing entity or the noteholders were utilized in selection of the additional accounts from the
available eligible accounts.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-indent: 0.25in">As described in &ldquo;<I>The Sponsor&mdash;Underwriting
Process</I>,&rdquo; the bank makes virtually all underwriting and authorization decisions using an automated system that considers
credit bureau information that is run through proprietary scoring models developed for the bank to calculate each applicant&rsquo;s
credit score. This automated system drives all decisions to approve or decline a customer&rsquo;s request for credit and also sets
an initial credit line on each approved customer&rsquo;s account, in each case without any underwriter discretion.</P>

or an existing cardholder has requested a credit line that exceeds the amount set by the automated system, the request is forwarded
to the Credit Solutions group for further consideration if such cardholder received the highest internal credit rating from the
automated system. Applicants with lower credit ratings are offered the maximum credit line permitted by the automated system without
any review by the Credit Solutions group. Once accounts are received by the Credit Solutions group, all requests for a higher credit
line are screened through a system that considers each applicant&rsquo;s bankruptcy history, ability to pay and recent increase
history. All accounts considered by the Credit Solutions group that pass the initial screen are then assessed by underwriters according
to operating procedures that consider certain account characteristics, including factors such as credit grade and delinquency history.
If an applicant satisfies all criteria specified by the operating procedures, the reviewing underwriter may grant a higher credit
line up to designated levels.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-indent: 0.25in">We have reviewed the credit line decisions
made by the Credit Solutions group that were identified by the bank&rsquo;s surveillance team as specified above between January
1, 2016 and January 31, 2019 for credit line decisions relating to the Retail Card platform that were exceptions to the underwriting
guidelines disclosed in this prospectus. Some of these credit line decisions were granted at or under the designated maximum level
permitted by the operating procedures, however such accounts were found to deviate from the disclosed underwriting guidelines for
the sole reason that they lacked requisite manager pre-approval. The remainder of the exceptions were determined to be exceptions
because the credit lines were found to be above the maximum level permitted by the operating procedures for those accounts. Based
on our review, the number of credit line decisions for which exceptions were identified represents less than 0.1% of accounts for
which credit was granted during such time period.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-indent: 0.25in">The bank determined to include the receivables
for which exceptions were identified in the trust portfolio because the exceptions would not have a material adverse effect on
the trust, and therefore, despite the exceptions to the underwriting criteria, the related receivables are eligible for sale to
the trust. With respect to these credit-related exceptions, the bank considers, as an additional compensating factor, that ongoing
credit monitoring enables the bank to adjust the credit limit as deemed necessary by the results of the behavioral scoring model
that is applied to each account periodically.</P>

of the event described in clause&nbsp;(e) of the preceding sentence), the asset representations reviewer will promptly resign with
90 calendar days&rsquo; prior written notice and the trust will appoint a successor asset representations reviewer. The trust may
immediately remove the asset representations reviewer if the asset representations reviewer ceases to be an eligible asset representations
reviewer, becomes legally unable to perform its obligations or becomes subject to a bankruptcy. In addition, the trust may remove
the asset representations reviewer with at least 30 calendar days&rsquo;&nbsp;prior written notice for any reason in its sole discretion
so long as any such termination will not be effective until the asset representations reviewer has completed and delivered all
review reports for any then in-progress Asset Review. If the asset representations reviewer resigns or is removed, replaced or
substituted, or if a new asset representations reviewer is appointed, we will specify the circumstances surrounding the change
on the monthly distribution report filed on Form&nbsp;10-D for the Monthly Period in which the change occurred. No resignation
or removal of the asset representations reviewer will be effective until a successor asset representations reviewer who is an eligible
asset representations reviewer is in place. The asset representations reviewer will pay the reasonable expenses of transitioning
its obligations under the asset representations review agreement and preparing the successor asset representations reviewer to
take on the obligations on receipt of an invoice with reasonable detail of the expenses from the bank, us or the successor asset
representations reviewer. However, the asset representations reviewer will not be responsible for paying such transitions expenses
if it is removed by the trust without cause or because it did not receive a payment required to be made in connection with an undisputed
invoice under the asset representations review agreement within 90 days after the bank had been given written notice of such non-payment.
Any costs associated with the removal of the asset representations reviewer and the appointment of a successor, to the extent not
paid by the asset representations reviewer, will be paid by the bank.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-indent: 0.25in">Euroclear was created in 1968 to hold securities
for participants of the Euroclear System and to clear and settle transactions between Euroclear participants through simultaneous
electronic book-entry delivery against payment, thereby eliminating the need for physical movement of notes and any risk from lack
of simultaneous transfers of securities and cash. Transactions may now be settled in any of 34 currencies, including United States
dollars. The Euroclear System includes various other services, including securities lending and borrowing and interfaces with domestic
markets in several countries generally similar to the arrangements for cross-market transfers with DTC described above. The Euroclear
System is operated by Euroclear Bank S.A./N.V. as the Euroclear operator. All operations are conducted by the Euroclear operator,
and all Euroclear securities clearance accounts and Euroclear cash accounts are accounts with the Euroclear operator. Euroclear
participants include central banks and other banks, securities brokers and dealers and other professional financial intermediaries
and may include the underwriters of any series of notes. Indirect access to the Euroclear System is also available to other firms
that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Euroclear participant, either directly or indirectly.</P>

with the Euroclear operator are governed by the Code of Conduct for Clearing and Settlement and the related Operating Procedures
of the Euroclear System. These terms and conditions govern transfers of securities and cash within the Euroclear System, withdrawal
of securities and cash from the Euroclear System, and receipts of payments with respect to securities in the Euroclear System.
All securities in the Euroclear System are held on a fungible basis without attribution of specific certificates to specific securities
clearance accounts. The Euroclear operator acts under these rules and laws only on behalf of Euroclear participants and has no
record of or relationship with persons holding through Euroclear participants.</P>

Clearstream or Euroclear will be credited to the cash accounts of Clearstream customers or Euroclear participants in accordance
with the relevant system&rsquo;s rules and procedures, to the extent received by its depositary. Those distributions will be subject
to tax reporting in accordance with relevant United States tax laws and regulations. See &ldquo;<I>U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences</I>&rdquo;
in this prospectus. Clearstream or the Euroclear operator, as the case may be, will take any other action permitted to be taken
by a noteholder under the indenture on behalf of a Clearstream customer or Euroclear participant only in accordance with its relevant
rules and procedures and subject to its depositary&rsquo;s ability to effect those actions on its behalf through DTC.</P>

out of the collections of transferred principal receivables allocable to those series, and will not be used to cover investor charge-offs

to reclassify a fixed percentage of collections of transferred principal receivables related to such program partner as collections

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-indent: 0.25in">We may exercise this option in order to compensate
for a decline in the portfolio yield, but only if there would be sufficient transferred principal receivables to allow for that
discounting. Exercise of this option would result in a larger amount of collections of finance charge receivables and a smaller
amount of collections of transferred principal receivables. By doing so, we would reduce the likelihood that an early amortization
event would occur as a result of a decreased portfolio yield and, at the same time, would increase the likelihood that we will
have to add principal receivables to the trust. We may not exercise our option to reclassify collections of transferred principal
receivables as collections of finance charge receivables if we reasonably believe that doing so would cause an early amortization
event or an event of default relating to any series, class or tranche of notes, or would materially and adversely affect the amount
of distributions to be made to the noteholders of any series, class or tranche of notes.</P>

in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York for orders authorizing discovery of the bank pursuant to Rule
2004 of the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure, related to an investigation of the bank&rsquo;s credit reporting. The discovery,
which is ongoing, concerns allegations made in <I>Belton et al. v. GE Capital Consumer Lending</I>, a putative class action adversary
proceeding pending in the same Bankruptcy Court. In the Belton adversary proceeding, which was filed on April 30, 2014, plaintiff
alleges that the bank violates the discharge injunction under Section 524(a)(2) of the Bankruptcy Code by attempting to collect
discharged debts and by failing to update and correct credit information to credit reporting agencies to show that such debts are
no longer due and owing because they have been discharged in bankruptcy. Plaintiff seeks declaratory judgment, injunctive relief
and an unspecified amount of damages. On December 15, 2014, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order staying the adversary proceeding
pending an appeal to the District Court of the Bankruptcy Court&rsquo;s order denying the bank&rsquo;s motion to compel arbitration.
On October 14, 2015, the District Court reversed the Bankruptcy Court and on November 4, 2015, the Bankruptcy Court granted the
bank&rsquo;s motion to compel arbitration.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-indent: 0.25in">The following is a summary of the material
U.S. federal income tax consequences of the purchase, ownership and disposition of the notes. This summary is based upon current
provisions of the Code, proposed, temporary and final Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder, and published rulings and court
decisions currently in effect. The current tax laws and the current regulations, rulings and court decisions may be changed, possibly
retroactively. The portions of this summary which relate to matters of law or legal conclusions represent the opinion of Mayer
Brown LLP, special federal tax counsel for the trust, as qualified in this summary.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-indent: 0.25in">The following summary does not furnish information
in the level of detail or with the attention to an investor&rsquo;s specific tax circumstances that would be provided by an investor&rsquo;s
own tax advisor. For example, it does not discuss the tax consequences of the purchase, ownership and disposition of the notes
by investors that are not U.S. Holders (except as discussed below in &ldquo;<I>&mdash;Tax Consequences to Holders of the Notes</I>&rdquo;)
or that are subject to special treatment under the U.S. federal income tax laws, including banks and thrifts, insurance companies,
regulated investment companies, dealers in securities, holders that will hold the notes as a position in a &ldquo;straddle&rdquo;
for tax purposes or as part of a &ldquo;synthetic security&rdquo; or &ldquo;conversion transaction&rdquo; or other integrated investment
comprised of the notes and one or more other investments, trusts and estates and pass-through entities, the equity holders of which
are any of these specified investors. In addition, the discussion regarding the notes is limited to the U.S. federal income tax
consequences of the initial investors unrelated to the trust and not a purchaser in the secondary market and also is limited to
investors who have purchased notes and hold those notes as capital assets within the meaning of Section&nbsp;1221 of the Code.</P>

of Mayer Brown LLP regarding certain U.S. federal income tax matters discussed below. An opinion of Mayer Brown LLP, however, is
not binding on the Internal Revenue Service (the &ldquo;<B>IRS</B>&rdquo;) or the courts. Moreover, there are no cases or IRS rulings
on similar transactions involving debt interests issued by a trust with terms similar to those of the notes. As a result, the IRS
may disagree with all or a part of the discussion below. No ruling on any of the issues discussed below will be sought from the
IRS.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-indent: 0.25in">On the closing date, Mayer Brown LLP, as tax
counsel to the trust, will deliver an opinion, subject to the assumptions and qualifications therein, to the effect that the trust
will not be classified as an association (or publicly traded partnership) taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax
purposes. This opinion is based on the assumption of compliance by all parties with the terms of the trust agreement and related
documents.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-indent: 0.25in">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-indent: 0.25in">If the trust were taxable as a corporation
for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the trust would be subject to corporate income tax on its taxable income. The trust&rsquo;s
taxable income would include all its income on the receivables, possibly reduced by its interest expense on the notes. Any corporate
income tax imposed on the trust could materially reduce cash available to make payments on the notes, and holders of any notes
not considered debt for U.S. federal income tax purposes could be liable for any tax that is unpaid by the trust.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-indent: 0.25in"><I>Treatment of the Notes as Indebtedness</I>.
The trust will agree, and if you purchase notes, you will agree by your purchase of the notes, to treat the notes as debt for all
purposes, including in all filings, reports and returns and otherwise. Each purchaser of the notes will covenant that neither it
nor any of its affiliates will take or participate in the taking of or permit to be taken, any action that is inconsistent with
the treatment of the advances made under any note as indebtedness. On the closing date, Mayer Brown LLP, as tax counsel to the
trust, will deliver an opinion, subject to the assumptions and qualifications therein, to the effect that the notes, other than
such notes beneficially owned by the trust or the single beneficial owner of the trust for U.S. federal income tax purposes, will
be classified as debt for federal income tax purposes. This opinion is based on Mayer Brown LLP&rsquo;s examination of this prospectus,
the indenture and such other documents, instruments and information Mayer Brown LLP considered necessary. The discussion below
assumes the notes are classified as debt for U.S. federal income tax purposes.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-indent: 0.25in"><I>&nbsp;</I></P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-indent: 0.25in"><I>OID</I>. The discussion below assumes that
the interest formula for the notes meets the requirements for &ldquo;qualified stated interest&rdquo; under Treasury regulations
(the &ldquo;<B>OID Regulations</B>&rdquo;) relating to original issue discount (&ldquo;<B>OID</B>&rdquo;). Under the OID Regulations,
the notes will have OID to the extent the principal amount of the notes exceeds their issue price. Further, if the notes have any
OID, it will be <I>de minimis</I> if it is less than 0.25% of the principal amount of the notes <I>multiplied by</I> the number
of full years included in their term. This discussion assumes that any OID on the notes is a <I>de minimis</I> amount, within the
meaning of the OID Regulations.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-indent: 0.25in">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-indent: 0.25in">Based on the above assumptions, except as discussed
below, the notes will not be considered issued with OID. If you buy notes you will be required to report as ordinary interest income
the stated interest on the notes when received or accrued in accordance with your method of tax accounting. Under the OID Regulations,
if you hold a note issued with a <I>de minimis</I> amount of OID, you must include this OID in income, on a <I>pro rata</I> basis,
as principal payments are made on the note. If you purchase a note in the secondary market for more or less than its principal
amount, you generally will be subject, respectively, to the premium amortization or market discount rules of the Code.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-indent: 0.25in"><I>&nbsp;</I></P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-indent: 0.25in"><I>Sale or Other Disposition of Notes</I>.
Upon the sale of a note, a noteholder will recognize gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference between the amount realized
on the sale and the noteholder&rsquo;s adjusted basis in the note. The adjusted tax basis of a note will equal the noteholder&rsquo;s
cost for the note, increased by any market discount, OID and gain previously included in the noteholder&rsquo;s income with respect
to the note and decreased by the amount of premium, if any, previously amortized and by the amount of principal payments previously
received on the note. Any gain or loss will be capital gain or loss, except for gain representing accrued interest and accrued
market discount not previously included in income. Capital losses generally may be used by a corporate taxpayer only to offset
capital gains, and by an individual taxpayer only to the extent of capital gains <I>plus</I> $3,000 of other income. In the case
of an individual taxpayer, any capital gain on the sale of a note will be taxed at the taxpayer&rsquo;s ordinary income tax rate
if the note is held for not more than 12&nbsp;months and at the taxpayer&rsquo;s maximum capital gains rate if the note is held
for more than 12&nbsp;months.</P>

the Code, which includes any GAAP financial statement, Form 10-K annual statement, audited financial statement or a financial statement
filed with any Federal agency for non-tax purposes), you generally will be required to include certain items of income such as
OID in gross income no later than the time such amounts are reflected on such a financial statement. This could result in an acceleration
of income recognition for income items differing from the above description, although the precise application of this rule is unclear

thresholds, you will be subject to an additional 3.8% Medicare tax on some or all of your &ldquo;net investment income.&rdquo;
Net investment income generally includes interest on, and gain from the disposition of, the notes unless such interest income or
gain is derived in the ordinary course of the conduct of a trade or business (other than a trade or business that consists of certain
passive or trading activities). You should consult your tax advisor regarding the effect this Medicare tax may have, if any, on
your acquisition, ownership or disposition of the notes.</P>

with these rules, neither the trust nor any paying agent nor any other person would, pursuant to the conditions of the notes, be
required to pay additional amounts as a result of the deduction or withholding of such tax. As a result, investors may receive
less interest or principal than expected. Certain countries have entered into, and other countries are expected to enter into,
agreements with the U.S. to facilitate the type of information reporting required under FATCA. While the existence of such agreements
will not eliminate the risk that notes will be subject to the withholding described above, these agreements are expected to reduce
the risk of the withholding for investors in (or indirectly holding notes through financial institutions in) those countries. If
applicable, FATCA withholding applies to payments of U.S. source dividends, interest, and other fixed payments and, beginning January&nbsp;1,
2019, to payments from the disposition of property producing such payments (e.g. notes). Treasury regulations were recently published
in proposed form that eliminate withholding on payments from such dispositions of such property. Pursuant to these proposed Treasury
regulations, the trust and any withholding agent may rely on this change to FATCA withholding until the final Treasury regulations
are issued. Noteholders should consult their own tax advisers on how these rules may apply to payments they receive under the notes.</P>

If, contrary to the opinion of Mayer Brown LLP, the IRS successfully asserted that one or more of the notes not beneficially owned
by the trust or the single beneficial owner of the trust for U.S. federal income tax purposes did not represent debt for U.S. federal
income tax purposes, such notes might be treated as equity interests in the trust. In this case, the trust would be treated as
a partnership and may be treated as a publicly traded partnership taxable as a corporation. Also, even if such a partnership was
not treated as a publicly traded partnership taxable as a corporation, treatment of the notes as equity interests in a partnership
could have adverse tax consequences to you. For example, if you are a foreign person, income to you might be subject to U.S. tax
and U.S. tax return filing and withholding requirements (including withholding on transfers of notes recharacterized as equity).
In addition, if you are an individual holder, to the extent trust expenses are treated as investment expenses, you might be subject
to certain limitations on your ability to deduct your share of trust expenses; on the other hand, to the extent the trust expenses
are treated as allocable to a trade or business, the amount or value of interest expense deductions available to you may be limited
under the rules of Section 163(j) of the Code. In addition, audit rules for partnerships require taxes arising from audit adjustments
to be paid by the entity rather than by its partners or members unless an entity elects otherwise. It is unclear to what extent
any elections pursuant to these rules will be available to the issuing entity and how any such elections may affect the procedural
rules available to challenge any audit adjustment that would otherwise be available in the absence of any such elections.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-indent: 0.25in">The above discussion does not address the tax
treatment of the trust, notes or holders of any notes issued by the issuing entity under any state or local tax laws, which may
differ materially from the U.S. federal income tax treatment of such persons and instruments. The activities undertaken by and
on behalf of the bank in originating the underlying accounts and receivables and the servicer in servicing and collecting the accounts
and receivables will take place throughout the United States and, therefore, may give rise to a taxable nexus where the bank and
servicer carry on their activities and where the obligors on the accounts are located. Accordingly, many different tax regimes
may apply to the trust and the holders of the notes including the jurisdictions in which the holder is taxable, the bank and any
sub-servicer carry on their activities, and the obligors on the accounts and receivables are located. Noteholders are urged to
consult their own tax advisors with respect to state and local tax treatment of the trust, as well as any state and local tax consequences,
arising out of the purchase, ownership and disposition of notes.</P>

Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (&ldquo;<B>ERISA</B>&rdquo;), and Section&nbsp;4975 of the Code prohibit a pension, profit-sharing
or other employee benefit plan that is subject to Title I of ERISA, as well as an individual retirement account, Keogh plan or
other plan covered by Section 4975 of the Code or an entity or account deemed to hold &ldquo;plan assets&rdquo; of any of the foregoing
(each a &ldquo;<B>Benefit Plan</B>&rdquo;), from engaging in specified transactions with persons that are &ldquo;parties in interest&rdquo;
under ERISA or &ldquo;disqualified persons&rdquo; under the Code with respect to these Benefit Plans. A violation of these &ldquo;prohibited
transaction&rdquo; rules may result in an excise tax or other penalties and liabilities under ERISA and the Code for these persons
or the fiduciaries of such Benefit Plans. Title I of ERISA also requires that fiduciaries of a Benefit Plan subject to Title I
of ERISA make investments that are prudent, diversified (unless clearly prudent not to do so), and in accordance with the governing
plan documents. The prudence of a particular investment must be determined by the responsible fiduciary of a Benefit Plan by taking
into account the particular circumstances of the Benefit Plan and all of the facts and circumstances of the investment, including,
but not limited to, the matters discussed under &ldquo;<I>Risk Factors&rdquo; </I>and the fact that in the future there may be
no market in which such Benefit Plan will be able to sell or otherwise dispose of the notes should it purchase them. Employee benefit
plans that are governmental plans, as defined in Section&nbsp;3(32) of ERISA, and certain church plans, as defined in Section&nbsp;3(33)
of ERISA, are not subject to the fiduciary and prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code, but may

none of the exceptions contained in the Plan Assets Regulation are applicable. An equity interest is defined under the Plan Assets
Regulation as an interest in an entity other than an instrument which is treated as indebtedness under applicable local law and
which has no substantial equity features. Although there is little guidance on the subject and there can be no assurances in this
regard, it is anticipated that, at the time of their issuance, the offered notes should be treated as debt without substantial
equity features for purposes of the Plan Assets Regulation. This determination is based upon the traditional debt features of the
offered notes, including the reasonable expectation of the purchasers of the offered notes that the offered notes will be repaid
when due, traditional default remedies, as well as the absence of conversion rights and other typical equity features. The debt
treatment of the offered notes for ERISA purposes could change after their issuance if the trust incurs losses. In the event of
a withdrawal or downgrade to below investment grade of the rating of the offered notes or a characterization of the offered notes
as other than indebtedness under applicable local law, the subsequent acquisition of the offered notes or interest therein by a
Benefit Plan or other plan that is subject to Similar Law is prohibited.</P>

stabilizing transactions, syndicate covering transactions and penalty bids may have the effect of raising or maintaining the market

an exposure to) a securitization, an institutional investor, other than the originator, sponsor or original lender (each as defined
in the EU Securitization Regulation) must, among other things: (a) verify that, where the originator or original lender is established
in a third country (that is, not within the EU or the EEA), the originator or original lender grants all the credits giving rise
to the underlying exposures on the basis of sound and well-defined criteria and clearly established processes for approving, amending,

is based on a thorough assessment of the obligor&rsquo;s creditworthiness, (b) verify that, if established in a third country,
the originator, sponsor or original lender retains on an ongoing basis a material net economic interest which, in any event, shall
not be less than 5%, determined in accordance with Article 6 of the EU Securitization Regulation, and discloses the risk retention
to institutional investors, (c) verify that the originator, sponsor or securitization special purpose entity (&ldquo;<B>SSPE</B>&rdquo;)
has, where applicable, made available the information required by Article 7 of the EU Securitization Regulation (which sets out
transparency requirements for originators, sponsors and SSPEs), and (d) carry out a due-diligence assessment which enables the
institutional investor to assess the risks involved, considering at least (i) the risk characteristics of the securitization position
and the underlying exposures, and (ii) all the structural features of the securitization that can materially impact the performance
of the securitization position.</P>

perform stress tests on the cash flows and collateral values supporting the underlying exposures, (c) ensure internal reporting

by (a) dividing (i) the aggregate amount of billed finance charges, late fees, cash advance fees and miscellaneous fees less related
waivers during the period indicated by (ii) the aggregate of the total receivables outstanding in the period indicated and (b)
multiplying the result in clause (a) by 12. In each case, the information is grouped by year of account origination. There can

rate experience on the credit card accounts in the selected portfolio for each of the periods shown. The delinquency rate is calculated
by dividing (i) the 30+ days past due delinquent amount as of the end of the period indicated by (ii) the total receivables outstanding
as of the end of the period indicated. Calculations are based on month-end data within the period. In each case, the information
is grouped by year of account origination. There can be no assurance that the delinquency rate experience for receivables in the
future will be similar to the historical experience set forth below.</P>

designated to the trust portfolio or removed from the trust portfolio may include up to a month of additional activity in the month
of such addition or removal, as applicable. The gross principal charge-off rate is calculated by dividing (i) the aggregate amount
of gross principal receivable charge-offs during the period indicated by (ii) the aggregate of the average total principal receivables
outstanding for each quarter in the period indicated.</P>

prospectus as of any date and used for purposes of calculating certain other statistical information presented in this prospectus,
including the Accounts Outstanding and Average Accounts Outstanding, includes certain accounts that have a zero balance and have
been closed due to the related credit card or cards being lost or stolen or the account being subject to fraudulent activity.&nbsp;
A credit card account that has been closed due to the related credit card or cards being lost or stolen or the account being subject
to fraudulent activity will remain in the securitization reporting system for a period of approximately twelve billing cycles,
and will be included in the calculation of the number of accounts for that period of time. The bank estimates that the number of
accounts in the trust portfolio was approximately 3.78% higher as of January 31, 2019, approximately 3.47% higher as of December
31, 2018, and approximately 0.46% higher as of December 31, 2017 than it would have been if such closed accounts were not included
in the total number of accounts.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-indent: 0.25in">The payment rate on the receivables is the
most important factor that will determine the size of principal payments after an early amortization event has occurred and whether
the trust has funds available to repay the notes on the scheduled principal payment date. The following Cardholder Monthly Payment
Rates tables set forth the highest and lowest cardholder monthly payment rates on the credit card accounts in the selected portfolio
and the trust portfolio during any calendar month in the calendar years or in the portion thereof, as applicable, shown, in each
case calculated as a percentage of the Receivables Outstanding as of the first day of each calendar month during the calendar years
or portion thereof, as applicable, shown. Payment rates shown in the tables are based on amounts that would be deemed payments
of receivables with respect to the accounts. For purposes of these calculations, Receivables Outstanding are receivables included
in the selected portfolio or the trust portfolio, as applicable, in the period indicated.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-indent: 0.25in">The Payment Status tables in this section show
the&nbsp;average&nbsp;for all billing cycles in the period indicated of the payments made on the receivables that fall within each
of the following categories: (1)&nbsp;less than minimum payment, (2)&nbsp;minimum payment, (3)&nbsp;greater than minimum payment,
but less than full payment and (4)&nbsp;full payment or greater than full payment. For any&nbsp;billing cycle, the percentage of
payments in each category is calculated by dividing the number of accounts with payments in that category by the total amount of
all accounts that were required to make payments on the receivables.</P>

described in &ldquo;<I>Risk Factors</I>,&rdquo; we cannot provide you with any assurance that the levels and timing of payments
on receivables in the selected portfolio and the trust portfolio from time to time in the future will be similar to the historical
experience described in the following tables for the selected portfolio and the trust portfolio or that deposits into the principal
funding account will equal the applicable controlled amortization amount.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-indent: 0.25in"><I>Trading between DTC seller and Clearstream
customer or Euroclear purchaser</I>. When global securities are to be transferred from the account of a DTC participant&mdash;other
than the depositaries for Clearstream and Euroclear&mdash;to the account of a Clearstream customer or a Euroclear participant,
the purchaser must send instructions to Clearstream prior to 12:30&nbsp;p.m. on the settlement date. Clearstream or Euroclear,
as the case may be, will instruct the respective depositary to receive the global securities for payment. Payment will then be
made by the respective depositary, as the case may be, to the DTC participant&rsquo;s account against delivery of the global securities.
After settlement has been completed, the global securities will be credited to the respective clearing system and by the clearing
system, in accordance with its usual procedures, to the Clearstream customer&rsquo;s or Euroclear participant&rsquo;s account.
Credit for the global securities will appear the next day (European time) and the cash debit will be back-valued to, and the interest
on the global securities will accrue from, the value date, which would be the preceding day when settlement occurred in New York.
If settlement is not completed on the intended value date (i.e., the trade fails), the Clearstream or Euroclear cash debit will
be valued instead as of the actual settlement date.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-indent: 0.25in">Clearstream customers and Euroclear participants
will need to make available to the respective clearing systems the funds necessary to process same-day funds settlement. The most
direct means of doing so is to pre-position funds for settlement, either from cash on hand or existing lines of credit, as they
would for any settlement occurring within Clearstream or Euroclear. Under this approach, they may take on credit exposure to Clearstream
or Euroclear until the global securities are credited to their accounts one day later.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-indent: 0.25in">As an alternative, if Clearstream or Euroclear
has extended a line of credit to them, Clearstream customers or Euroclear participants can elect not to pre-position funds and
allow that credit line to be drawn upon to finance settlement. Under this procedure, Clearstream customers or Euroclear participants
purchasing global securities would incur overdraft charges for one day, assuming they cleared the overdraft when the global securities
were credited to their accounts. However, interest on the global securities would accrue from the value date. Therefore, in many
cases the investment income on the global securities earned during that one-day period may substantially reduce or offset the amount
of such overdraft charges, although this result will depend on each Clearstream customer&rsquo;s or Euroclear participant&rsquo;s
particular cost of funds.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-indent: 0.25in">Since the settlement is taking place during
New York business hours, DTC participants can employ their usual procedures for sending global securities to the respective European
depositary for the benefit of Clearstream customers or Euroclear participants. The sale proceeds will be available to the DTC seller
on the settlement date. Thus, to the DTC participant a cross-market transaction will settle no differently from a trade between
two DTC participants.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-indent: 0.25in"><I>Trading between Clearstream or Euroclear
seller and DTC purchaser</I>. Due to time zone differences in their favor, Clearstream customers and Euroclear participants may
employ their customary procedures for transactions in which global securities are to be transferred by the respective clearing
system, through the respective European depositary, to another DTC participant. The seller will send instructions to Clearstream
before 12:30&nbsp;p.m. on the settlement date. In these cases, Clearstream or Euroclear will instruct the respective European depositary,
as appropriate, to credit the global securities to the DTC participant&rsquo;s account against payment. The payment will then be
reflected in the account of the Clearstream customer or Euroclear participant the following day, and receipt of the cash proceeds
in the Clearstream customer&rsquo;s or Euroclear participant&rsquo;s account would be back-valued to the value date, which would
be the preceding day, when settlement occurred in New York. If the Clearstream customer or Euroclear participant has a line of
credit with its respective clearing system and elects to draw on such line of credit in anticipation of receipt of the sale proceeds
in its account, the back-valuation may substantially reduce or offset any overdraft charges incurred over that one-day period.
If settlement is not completed on the intended value date (i.e., the trade fails), receipt of the cash proceeds in the Clearstream
customer&rsquo;s or Euroclear participant&rsquo;s account would instead be valued as of the actual settlement date.</P>
