“forward-looking statements” that involve risks and uncertainties. You can identify forward-looking statements because they contain words such as “believes,” “expects,” “may,” “will,”
“should,” “would,” “could,” “seeks,” “approximately,” “intends,” “plans,” “estimates,” “anticipates” or similar expressions that relate to our strategy, plans
or intentions. All statements we make relating to our estimated and projected earnings, margins, costs, expenditures, cash flows, growth rates and financial results or to our expectations regarding future industry trends are forward-looking
statements. In addition, we, through our senior management, from time to time make forward-looking public statements concerning our expected future operations and performance and other developments. These forward-looking statements are subject to
risks and uncertainties that may change at any time and, therefore, our actual results may differ materially from those that we expected. We derive many of our forward-looking statements from our operating budgets and forecasts, which are based upon
many detailed assumptions. While we believe that our assumptions are reasonable, we caution that it is very difficult to predict the impact of known factors and it is impossible for us to anticipate all factors that could affect our actual results.
All forward-looking statements are based upon information available to us on the date of this prospectus. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Important factors that could

without limitation, in conjunction with the forward-looking statements included in this prospectus supplement and accompanying prospectus. All forward-looking information in this prospectus supplement and accompanying prospectus and subsequent
written and oral forward-looking statements attributable to us, or to persons acting on our behalf, are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements. Some of the factors that we believe could affect our results include: </P>

this prospectus supplement, the accompanying prospectus and in our Annual Report on Form <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">10-K</FONT> for the fiscal year ended June&nbsp;30, 2018 and in other reports we file with the SEC, before deciding whether to

Inc. is a leading provider of information technology (“IT”) solutions to its clients in North America. We enable business transformation through our expertise in IT solutions for agile, secure infrastructure solution sets, with a specific
focus on Digital Infrastructure, Cloud and Security solutions. Our solutions are delivered through a broad suite of professional services, including strategy, consulting, design and implementation. We complement our professional services with
project management, technology acquisition, managed services, maintenance and support to offer a full lifecycle model. Our <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">services-led,</FONT> lifecycle model leads to ongoing client engagement. As of June&nbsp;30,
2018, we serve approximately 8,000 middle-market, large, and government organizations across a diverse range of industries. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our clients
are increasingly dependent on Presidio to develop best of breed, vendor-agnostic, agile, and secure infrastructure solution sets comprised of Digital Infrastructure, Cloud, and Security solutions. Through our increasing focus on agile, secure
infrastructure sets, we believe we are well positioned to benefit from the rapid growth in demand for Digital Infrastructure, Cloud and Security technologies. Within our three solutions areas, we offer customers enterprise-class solutions that are
critical to driving digital transformation and expanding business capabilities. Examples of such solutions include advanced networking, Internet of Things, data analytics, data center modernization, hybrid and multi-cloud, cyber risk management and
enterprise mobility. These solutions are enabled by our expertise in foundational technologies, built upon our investments in network, data center, security, collaboration and mobility. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The middle market is a highly attractive segment of the IT services market, and we are differentiated by our strategic focus on this
attractive segment. The increasing potential and complexity of emerging technologies and digital transformation are creating more demand for our solutions and services. Customers in the middle market are usually large enough to have substantial
technology needs but typically have fewer IT resources and lack the broad expertise required to develop the necessary solutions as compared to larger companies. As a trusted solutions provider, our clients rely on us for IT investment decisions. We
simplify IT for them by building solutions utilizing what we view as the best possible technologies. Since many large-scale IT service providers focus on larger enterprises, and because many resellers are unable to provide <FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">end-to-end</FONT></FONT> solutions, we believe the middle market has remained underpenetrated and underserved. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We develop and maintain our long-term client relationships through a localized direct sales force of approximately 500 employees based in over
60 offices across the United States as of June&nbsp;30, 2018. As a strategic partner and trusted advisor to our clients, we provide the expertise to implement new solutions, as well as optimize and better leverage existing IT resources. We provide
strategy, consulting, design, customized deployment, integration and lifecycle management through our team of over 1,600 engineers as of June&nbsp;30, 2018, </P>

education, and professional services are our largest categories. We believe that our diversified client profile is a key driver of our ability to generate growth across different economic and technology cycles. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Presidio was incorporated on November 20, 2014 by certain investment funds affiliated with or managed by affiliates of Apollo Global
Management, LLC (“Apollo”), including AP VIII Aegis Holdings, L.P. (“Aegis L.P.”), along with their parallel investment funds to complete the acquisition of Presidio Holdings Inc. The shares to be sold by Aegis L.P. in this
offering represent approximately 12.3% of its aggregate shares of the Company’s common stock. After this offering, Aegis L.P. will beneficially own an aggregate of 35,125,000 shares of common stock, which represent, in the aggregate,
approximately 42.5% of the outstanding shares of common stock, based on the number of shares outstanding as of March&nbsp;8, 2019. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Upon
completion of this offering, Aegis L.P. will continue to be able to exert significant influence over us as a result of its significant ownership and voting power with respect to our common stock. For instance, so long as the Apollo Funds (as defined
below) own (a) at least 30% but less than 50% of our outstanding common stock, they will have the right to designate up to four nominees to our Board of Directors, (b) at least 20% but less than 30% of our outstanding common stock, they will have
the right to designate up to three nominees to our Board of Directors and (c) at least 10% but less than 20% of our outstanding common stock, they will have the right to designate two nominees to our Board of Directors. See “Risk

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Investing in our common stock involves significant risks. Before you invest in our common stock, in addition to the other information contained
in this prospectus supplement and the accompanying prospectus, you should carefully consider the risk factors discussed under Item 1A, Risk Factors, beginning on page 10 of our Annual Report on Form <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">10-K</FONT> for
the fiscal year ended June&nbsp;30, 2018, filed with the SEC on September 6, 2018, which is incorporated by reference in this prospectus supplement, and the other risks and uncertainties identified in Presidio’s reports filed with the SEC that
are incorporated or deemed incorporated by reference into this prospectus supplement and the accompanying prospectus. See “Where You Can Find More Information and Incorporation by Reference.” These risks are not the only risks that we
face. Our business, financial condition and results of operations could also be affected by additional factors that are not presently known to us or that we currently do not consider to be material. In addition, you should carefully consider the
risk factors set forth below. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Risks Related to the Offering and an Investment in Our Common Stock </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>While we are no longer a controlled company, after the consummation of this offering Aegis L.P. will continue to hold approximately 42.5% of our common
stock and will continue to have the ability to exert significant influence over us, and its interests may conflict with or differ from your interests as a stockholder. </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">After the consummation of this offering, Aegis L.P. will hold approximately 42.5% of our common stock. The interests of Apollo could conflict
with or differ from the interests of other holders of our common stock. For example, the concentration of ownership held by Aegis L.P. could delay, defer or prevent a change of control of the Company or impede a merger, takeover or other business
combination that a stockholder may otherwise view favorably. In addition, a sale of a substantial number of shares of stock in the future by Aegis L.P. could cause our stock price to decline. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, the stockholders’ agreement with Aegis L.P. that we entered into in connection with our IPO provides that, except as
otherwise required by applicable law, if Aegis L.P. and Apollo Investment Fund VIII, L.P. (“Apollo Fund VIII”), along with their parallel investment funds (collectively, the “Apollo Funds”), hold (a)&nbsp;at least 50% of our
outstanding common stock, they will have the right to designate up to five nominees to our Board of Directors, (b)&nbsp;at least 30% but less than 50% of our outstanding common stock, they will have the right to designate up to four nominees to our
Board of Directors, (c)&nbsp;at least 20% but less than 30% of our outstanding common stock, they will have the right to designate up to three nominees to our Board of Directors and (d)&nbsp;at least 10% but less than 20% of our outstanding common
stock, they will have the right to designate two nominees to our Board of Directors. The agreement provides that if the size of our Board of Directors is increased or decreased at any time, the nomination rights of the Apollo Funds will be
proportionately increased or decreased, respectively, rounded up to the nearest whole number. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Additionally, the group of (a)&nbsp;Apollo,

(d)&nbsp;any affiliate of the foregoing (in each case, other than the Company and its subsidiaries) (collectively, the “Apollo Group”) is in the business of making or advising on investments in companies and holds (and may from time to
time in the future acquire) interests in or provides advice to businesses that directly or indirectly compete with certain portions of our business or are suppliers or customers of ours. The Apollo Group may also pursue acquisitions that may be
complementary to our business and, as a result, those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our certificate of

duty by reason of the fact that any such individual pursues or acquires a corporate opportunity for its own account or the account of an affiliate, as applicable, instead of us, </P>

to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and other employees. Alternatively, if a

requirements of and related rules under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the Dodd-Frank Act, is expensive and time- consuming and any delays or difficulties in satisfying these obligations could have a material adverse effect on our future results

the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (“Dodd-Frank”). The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires that we maintain effective disclosure controls and
procedures and internal control for financial reporting. Under Section&nbsp;404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and pursuant to the terms therein, our independent public accountants auditing our financial statements must attest to the effectiveness of our
internal control over financial reporting. To continue to maintain the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, significant resources and management oversight are required. To comply with
the requirements of being a public company, we may need to undertake various actions, such as implementing new internal controls and procedures and hiring additional accounting or internal audit staff. In addition, we may identify control
deficiencies which could result in a material weakness or significant deficiency. Furthermore, if we are unable to conclude that our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting are effective, or if our
independent public accounting firm is unable to provide us with an unqualified report as to management’s assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting in future years, investors may lose confidence in our
financial reports and our stock price may decline. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, Dodd-Frank, which amended the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and other federal laws,
has created uncertainty for public companies and we cannot predict with any certainty the requirements of the regulations that will ultimately be adopted under Dodd-Frank or how such regulations will affect the cost of compliance for a company with
publicly traded common stock. There is likely to be continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters because the application of these laws and regulations, which are subject to varying interpretations, may evolve over time as new guidance is
provided by regulatory and governing bodies. We intend to invest resources to comply with these evolving laws and regulations, which may result in increased general and administrative expenses and divert management’s time and attention from
other business concerns. Furthermore, if our compliance efforts differ from the activities that regulatory and governing bodies expect or intend due to ambiguities related to interpretation or practice, we may face legal proceedings initiated by
such regulatory or governing bodies and our business may be harmed. In addition, new rules and regulations may make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified directors and officers and may make it more expensive for us to obtain
director and officer liability insurance. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>If securities analysts do not publish research or reports about our company, or if they publish

trading market for our common stock depends in part on the research and reports that third-party securities analysts publish about our company and our industry. One or more analysts could downgrade our common stock or issue other negative commentary
about our company or our industry. Alternatively, if one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company, we could lose visibility in the market. As a result of one or more of these factors, the trading price of our common stock could

forward-looking statements because they contain words such as “believes,” “expects,” “may,” “will,” “should,” “would,” “could,” “seeks,” “approximately,”
“intends,” “plans,” “estimates,” “anticipates” or similar expressions that relate to our strategy, plans or intentions. All statements we make relating to our estimated and projected earnings, margins, costs,
expenditures, cash flows, growth rates and financial results or to our expectations regarding future industry trends are forward-looking statements. In addition, we, through our senior management, from time to time make forward-looking public
statements concerning our expected future operations and performance and other developments. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may change at any time and, therefore, our actual results may differ materially
from those that we expected. We derive many of our forward-looking statements from our operating budgets and forecasts, which are based upon many detailed assumptions. While we believe that our assumptions are reasonable, we caution that it is very
difficult to predict the impact of known factors and it is impossible for us to anticipate all factors that could affect our actual results. All forward-looking statements are based upon information available to us on the date of this prospectus.

prospectus and subsequent written and oral forward-looking statements attributable to us, or to persons acting on our behalf, are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements. Some of the factors that we believe could affect

determined the specific portion of any net proceeds to be used for these purposes, and the net proceeds from this offering have not been accounted for in our normal budgeting process. Although from time to time we evaluate possible acquisitions of
companies and assets, we currently have no definitive commitments or agreements to make any acquisitions, and cannot assure you that we will make any acquisitions in the future. The amounts actually expended for these purposes may vary significantly
and will depend on a number of factors, including the amount of cash we generate from future operations, the actual expenses of operating our business, opportunities that may be or become available to us. </P>

Securityholders Agreement. The selling stockholders will bear any underwriting fees, discounts and similar charges attributable to their sale of our common stock, and we will bear the remaining expenses. See “Selling Stockholders.” </P>

Exchange Act that are incorporated by reference into this prospectus. Apollo and each of such officers who may offer shares of common stock pursuant to this prospectus acquired the shares prior to the date of the filing of the registration statement

governance rules of the NASDAQ, which exempts us from certain requirements, including the requirements that we have a majority of independent directors on our Board of Directors and that we have Compensation and Nominating and Corporate Governance

at each annual meeting of stockholders, with such elections decided by plurality vote. The classification of directors has the effect of making it more difficult for stockholders to change the composition of our Board of Directors. Each director
holds office until his successor is duly elected and qualified or until his earlier death, disqualification, resignation or removal. Any vacancies on our Board of Directors, including by reason of an increase in the authorized number of directors,
may be filled only by the affirmative vote of a majority of the remaining directors, although less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining director, except as provided in the Apollo Stockholders Agreement, as described above. Directors so chosen shall
hold office for a term expiring at the annual meeting of stockholders at which the term of office of the class to which they have been appointed expires and until their successors are duly elected and shall qualify, unless sooner displaced. Our
Amended Certificate provides that stockholders do not have the right to cumulative voting in the election of directors. At any meeting of our Board of Directors, except as otherwise required by law, a majority of the total number of directors that
the Company would have if there were no vacancies will constitute a quorum for all purposes. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our Amended Bylaws provide that, subject to
applicable law and the rights of the holders of any series of preferred stock, any director, or the entire Board of Directors, may be removed from office at any time, but only for cause and only by the affirmative vote of holders of shares entitled
to cast at least a majority of the votes entitled to be cast generally in the election of directors. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Special Meetings of Stockholders </B></P>

benefit to a stockholder and an “interested stockholder” is a person who, together with affiliates and associates, owns (or within three years, did own) 15% or more of a corporation’s voting stock. The DGCL generally defines
“interested stockholder” as any person who, together with affiliates and associates, is the owner of 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock or is our affiliate or associate and was the owner of 15% or more of our outstanding voting
stock at any time within the three-year period immediately before the date of determination. The statute could prohibit or delay mergers or other takeover or change in control attempts and, accordingly, may discourage attempts to acquire us even
though such a transaction may offer our stockholders the opportunity to sell their stock at a price above the prevailing market price. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The provisions of the DGCL, our Amended Certificate and our Amended Bylaws could have the effect of discouraging others from attempting
hostile takeovers and, as a consequence, they may also inhibit temporary fluctuations in the market price of our common stock that often result from actual or rumored hostile takeover attempts. These provisions may also have the effect of preventing
changes in our management. It is possible that these provisions could make it more difficult to accomplish transactions that stockholders may otherwise deem to be in their best interests. </P>
