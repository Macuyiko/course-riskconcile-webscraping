online video on-demand (&ldquo;VOD&rdquo;) networks that provide positive and entertaining video content for all screens. We also
curate, produce and distribute long- and short-form video content that brings out the best of the human spirit, and distribute
the online content of our subsidiary, A Plus. We are aggressively growing our business through a combination of organic growth,
licensing and distribution arrangements, acquisitions and strategic relationships. We are also expanding our partnerships with
sponsors, television networks and independent producers. Our subsidiary, Screen Media, is a leading global independent television
and film distribution company, which owns one of the largest independently owned television and film libraries. We also own Popcornflix<SUP>&reg;</SUP>,
a popular online advertiser-supported VOD (&ldquo;AVOD&rdquo;) network, Pivotshare, a subscription-based VOD (&ldquo;SVOD&rdquo;)

for all screens, including mobile devices. We expect the increasingly widespread penetration of 5G mobile networks, with virtually

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">Since our inception in January 2015, our
business has grown rapidly. For the full year 2017, our audited net revenue was $10.7 million, as compared to 2016 audited net
revenue for the full year of $8.1 million. For the nine months ended September 30, 2018, our net revenue was $15.1 million, as
compared to net revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 of $2.3 million. These increases were primarily due to the
acquisition of Screen Media in November 2017 and the growth of our online networks and television and short-form video production
business. We had audited net income of $22.8 million for the full year 2017, as compared to a full year audited net income of $0.8
million in 2016. The full year 2017 included a gain on bargain purchase of $24.3 million and acquisition-related expenses of $2.2
million relating to the acquisition of Screen Media, as discussed in the 2017 10-K under the section entitled &ldquo;<I>Management&rsquo;s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&mdash;Recent Developments&mdash;Acquisition of Screen

$4.0 million for the full year, as compared to full year 2016 unaudited Adjusted EBITDA of $3.8 million. For the nine months ended
September 30, 2018, our unaudited Adjusted EBITDA was $5.2 million, as compared to unaudited Adjusted EBITDA for the nine months

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">To date we have reported the vast majority
of our revenue and net income in the fourth quarter of each year. We have begun to sign sponsorship contracts, and are beginning
production of some series, earlier in the year than in recent years. This has resulted in more balanced revenue across the year.
Additionally, revenue from both our online networks and television and film distribution business areas are more evenly spaced
throughout the year, which should result in more balanced revenue, net income and Adjusted EBITDA going forward across all quarters
of each year. While the operating results in these areas are expected to be more evenly distributed over fiscal quarters, the fourth
quarter is generally the strongest quarter and the second quarter is generally the weakest quarter.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">Our vision is to use our solid core of
traditional media production and distribution assets to build a powerful portfolio of online VOD networks and assets. Our production
and distribution businesses generate current revenue and Adjusted EBITDA to fund our rapidly growing online networks. We will build
and acquire assets such as content libraries, digital publishers with content related to our own, and stand-alone VOD networks.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">One of our fundamental objectives is to
continue to grow our VOD networks to create a &ldquo;network of networks&rdquo; as we continue to increase our content offerings
to critical mass. Our strategy is to build our library of video content through a combination of Chicken Soup for the Soul original
video content and opportunistic acquisitions of third-party video content libraries, such as our transformative acquisition of
Screen Media, or other rights to video content as distressed networks seek to monetize their content libraries. We now own exhibition
or distribution rights to over 35,000 hours of programming across our various platforms.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">Our entry into subscription-based VOD was
recently initiated by our acquisition of the Pivotshare VOD network in August 2018. Pivotshare is comprised of a series of subscription-based

25,000 paid subscriptions with average monthly billings of $9 per subscription.</P>

content library includes 2,500 hours of programming and brings us an additional 630,000 Facebook fans. Truli&rsquo;s content fits
strategically in our plans and includes film, television, music videos, sports, comedy, and educational material. With the completion
of the acquisition, Truli became our seventh advertiser-supported VOD channel.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">In December 2018, we acquired all of the
outstanding capital stock of A Plus, an affiliate of ours. Prior to the acquisition, A Plus was majority owned by an affiliate
of CSS and, pursuant to a Distribution Agreement, we had the exclusive worldwide rights to distribute all video content (in any
and all formants) and all editorial content (including articles, photos and still images) created, produced, edited or delivered
by A Plus, and we received a net distribution fee equal to 30% of gross revenue generated by the distribution of the A Plus video

generated by A Plus going forward, along with projected cost savings of over $5 million for our company in 2019.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">Screen Media&rsquo;s distribution capabilities
across all media will allow us to distribute our produced television series directly and eliminate the distribution fees (as much

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">We are a Delaware corporation formed on
May 4, 2016. CSS Productions, our predecessor and immediate parent company, was formed in December 2014 by CSS, and initiated operations
in January 2015. We were formed to create a discrete entity focused on video content opportunities using the Brand. In May 2016,
pursuant to the terms of the contribution agreement among CSS, CSS Productions and the Company (the &ldquo;CSS Contribution Agreement&rdquo;),
all video content assets (the &ldquo;Subject Assets&rdquo;) owned by CSS, CSS Productions and their CSS subsidiaries were transferred
to the Company in consideration for its issuance to CSS Productions of 8,600,568 shares of the Company&rsquo;s Class B Common Stock.
Since the date of the CSS Contribution Agreement, CSS Productions has transferred certain of these shares of Class&nbsp;B Common
Stock to third parties and certain of these shares of Class B Common Stock have been converted into Class A Common Stock at the
election of the holders thereof. Concurrently with the consummation of the CSS Contribution Agreement, certain rights to receive
payments under certain agreements comprising part of the Subject Assets owned by Trema, LLC (&ldquo;Trema&rdquo;), a company principally
owned and controlled by William J. Rouhana, Jr., the Company&rsquo;s chairman and chief executive officer, were assigned to the
Company under a contribution agreement (the &ldquo;Trema Contribution Agreement&rdquo;) in consideration for the Company&rsquo;s
issuance to Trema of 159,432 shares or our Class B Common Stock. Thereafter, CSS Productions&rsquo; operating activities ceased,
and the Company continued the business operations of producing and distributing the video content.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">In addition to the results reported in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (&ldquo;GAAP&rdquo;), we use a financial measure which is not recognized

reader&rsquo;s understanding of our historical and current financial performance. Management believes that this measure provides
useful information in that it excludes amounts that are not indicative of our core operating results and ongoing operations and
provides a more consistent basis for comparison between periods. The non-GAAP financial measure that we currently use is Adjusted
EBITDA which is defined as follows:</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">&ldquo;Adjusted EBITDA&rdquo; means earnings
before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, acquisition-related costs, consulting fees related to the acquisition of Screen
Media and non-cash share-based compensation expense, and adjustments for other identified charges, such as costs incurred to form
our company and to prepare for the offering of our Class A common stock to the public, prior to our initial public offering (&ldquo;IPO&rdquo;).
Adjusted EBITDA does not include the gain on bargain purchase of Screen Media. Identified charges also include the cost of maintaining
a board of directors prior to being a publicly traded company. As our IPO has been completed, director fees are deducted from Adjusted
EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA is not an earnings measure recognized by GAAP and does not have a standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP;
accordingly, Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. We believe Adjusted EBITDA
to be a meaningful indicator of our performance that provides useful information to investors regarding our financial condition
and results of operations. The most comparable GAAP measure is operating income.</P>

in our Series A Preferred Stock, you should consider carefully the risk factors described below and in the accompanying base prospectus,

condition could be materially and adversely affected. This could cause the trading price of our Series A Preferred Stock to decline
and you may lose all or part of your investment. The risk factors described in our SEC filings and below are not the only ones
that we face. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also significantly impair our
business operations and could result in a complete loss of your investment.</I></P>

in the distribution of our assets will rank junior to the prior claims of our current and future creditors and any future series
or class of preferred stock we may issue that ranks senior to the Series A Preferred Stock. Also, the Series A Preferred Stock
effectively ranks junior to all existing and future indebtedness and to the indebtedness and other liabilities of our existing
subsidiaries and any future subsidiaries. Our existing subsidiaries are, and future subsidiaries would be, separate legal entities
and have no legal obligation to pay any amounts to us in respect of dividends due on the Series A Preferred Stock.</P>

incur substantial amounts of debt and other obligations that will rank senior to the Series A Preferred Stock. As of the date of
this prospectus supplement, our total liabilities (excluding contingent consideration) equaled approximately $16 million, including
$8.1 million owed under a commercial loan facility consisting of a $5 million term loan and $3.5 million owed under our revolving
credit line with our bank (&ldquo;Bank Loan Facility&rdquo;). If we are forced to liquidate our assets to pay our creditors, we
may not have sufficient assets to pay amounts due on any or all of the Series A Preferred Stock then outstanding.</P>

exceed our net earnings in excess of its debt service obligations. We are currently in compliance with all of our covenants under

during the fiscal year in which the dividend is declared and/or the preceding fiscal year, or a &ldquo;surplus&rdquo;, meaning
the excess, if any, of our net assets (total assets less total liabilities) over our capital. We can provide no assurance that
we will satisfy such requirements in any given year. Further, even if we have the legal ability to declare a dividend, we may not
have sufficient cash to pay dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock. Our ability to pay dividends may be impaired if any of the
risks described in this prospectus supplement actually occur. Also, payment of our dividends depends upon our financial condition
and other factors as our board of directors may deem relevant from time to time. We cannot assure you that our businesses will
generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable
us to pay dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock.</P>

listed on the Nasdaq Global Market under the symbol &ldquo;CSSEP.&rdquo; We cannot assure you that the Series A Preferred Stock
will continue to be listed on the Nasdaq Global Market in the future. In order to continue listing the Series A Preferred Stock
on the Nasdaq Global Market, we must maintain certain financial, distribution, and share price levels. Generally, this means having
a minimum number of publicly held shares of Series A Preferred Stock (generally 100,000 shares), a minimum market value (generally
$1,000,000) and a minimum number of holders (generally 100 public holders). If our Class A common stock is delisted from the Nasdaq
Global Market, the Series A Preferred Stock would be required to meet the more stringent initial listing standards of the Nasdaq
Global Market for a Primary Equity Security, including a minimum number of publicly held shares of Series A Preferred Stock (generally
1,100,000 shares) and a minimum number of holders (generally 400 public holders). If we are unable to meet these standards and
the Series A Preferred Stock is delisted from the Nasdaq Global Market, we may apply to list our Series A Preferred Stock on the
Nasdaq Capital Market. If we are also unable to meet the listing standards for the Nasdaq Capital Market, we may apply to have
our Series A Preferred Stock quoted by OTC Markets. If we are unable to maintain listing for the Series A Preferred Stock, the
ability to transfer or sell shares of the Series A Preferred Stock will be limited and the market value of the Series A Preferred
Stock will likely be materially adversely affected. Moreover, since the Series A Preferred Stock has no stated maturity date, investors
may be forced to hold shares of the Series A Preferred Stock indefinitely while receiving stated dividends thereon when, as and
if authorized by our board of directors and paid by us with no assurance as to ever receiving the liquidation value thereof.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">Liquidity of the market for the Series
A Preferred Stock depends on a number of factors, including prevailing interest rates, our financial condition and operating results,
the number of holders of the Series A Preferred Stock, the market for similar securities and the interest of securities dealers
in making a market in the Series A Preferred Stock. We cannot predict the extent to which investor interest in our Company will
maintain a trading market in our Series A Preferred Stock, or how liquid that market will be. If an active market is not maintained,
investors may have difficulty selling shares of our Series A Preferred Stock.</P>

series of preferred stock that rank above the Series A Preferred Stock as to dividend payments and rights upon our liquidation,
dissolution or winding up of our affairs, only with the approval of the holders of at least 66.67% of the outstanding Series A
Preferred Stock; however, we are allowed to issue additional shares of Series A Preferred Stock and/or additional series of preferred
stock that would rank equally to the Series A Preferred Stock as to dividend payments and rights upon our liquidation or winding
up of our affairs without first obtaining the approval of the holders of our Series A Preferred Stock. The issuance of additional
shares of Series A Preferred Stock and/or additional series of preferred stock could have the effect of reducing the amounts available
to the Series A Preferred Stock upon our liquidation or dissolution or the winding up of our affairs. It also may reduce dividend
payments on the Series A Preferred Stock if we do not have sufficient funds to pay dividends on all Series A Preferred Stock outstanding
and other classes or series of stock with equal or senior priority with respect to dividends. Future issuances and sales of senior
or pari passu preferred stock, or the perception that such issuances and sales could occur, may cause prevailing market prices
for the Series A Preferred Stock and our Class A common stock to decline and may adversely affect our ability to raise additional
capital in the financial markets at times and prices favorable to us.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">One of the factors that will influence
the price of the Series A Preferred Stock is the dividend yield on the Series A Preferred Stock (as a percentage of the market
price of the Series A Preferred Stock) relative to market interest rates. Continued increase in market interest rates may lead
prospective purchasers of the Series A Preferred Stock to expect a higher dividend yield (and higher interest rates would likely
increase our borrowing costs and potentially decrease funds available for dividend payments). Thus, higher market interest rates
could cause the market price of the Series A Preferred Stock to materially decrease.</P>

holders of the Series A Preferred Stock may be subject to tax at the preferential tax rates applicable to &ldquo;qualified dividend
income,&rdquo; only if we have current or accumulated earnings and profits, as determined for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
Additionally, we may not have sufficient current earnings and profits during future fiscal years for the distributions on the Series
A Preferred Stock to qualify as dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If the distributions fail to qualify as dividends,
U.S. holders would be unable to use the dividends-received deduction and may not be eligible for the preferential tax rates applicable

of the Code, U.S. Treasury regulations, rulings and judicial decisions as of the date hereof. These authorities may change, perhaps
retroactively, which could result in U.S. federal income tax consequences different from those summarized below. This discussion
does not address all aspects of U.S. federal income taxation (such as the alternative minimum tax) and does not describe any foreign,
state, local or other tax considerations that may be relevant to a purchaser or holder of the Series A Preferred Stock in light
of their particular circumstances. In addition, this discussion does not describe the U.S. federal income tax consequences applicable
to a purchaser or a holder of the Series A Preferred Stock who is subject to special treatment under U.S. federal income tax laws
(including, a corporation that accumulates earnings to avoid U.S. federal income tax, a pass-through entity or an investor in
a pass-through entity, a tax-exempt entity, pension or other employee benefit plans, financial institutions or broker dealers,
persons holding the Series A Preferred Stock as part of a hedging or conversion transaction or straddle, a person subject to the
alternative minimum tax, an insurance company, former U.S. citizens or former long-term U.S. residents). We cannot assure you
that a change in law will not significantly alter the tax considerations that we describe in this discussion.</P>

corporation issues preferred stock that may be redeemed at a price higher than its issue price, the excess (a &ldquo;redemption
premium&rdquo;) is treated under certain circumstances as a constructive distribution (or series of constructive distributions)
of additional preferred stock. The constructive distribution of property equal to the redemption premium would accrue without regard
to the holder&rsquo;s method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes at a constant yield determined under principles
similar to the determination of original issue discount (&ldquo;OID&rdquo;) pursuant to Treasury regulations under Sections 1271
through 1275 of the Code (the &ldquo;OID Rules&rdquo;). The constructive distributions of property would be treated for U.S. federal
income tax purposes as actual distributions of the Series A Preferred Stock that would constitute a dividend, return of capital
or capital gain to the holder of the stock in the same manner as cash distributions described under &ldquo;<I>Certain U.S. Federal
Income Tax Considerations - U.S. Holders: Distributions in General</I>.&rdquo; The application of principles similar to those applicable

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">The call option should not require constructive
distributions of the redemption premium, if based on all of the facts and circumstances as of the issue date, a redemption pursuant
to the call option is not more likely than not to occur. The Treasury regulations provide that an issuer&rsquo;s right to redeem
will not be treated as more likely than not to occur if: (i) the issuer and the holder of the stock are not related within the
meaning of Section 267(b) or Section 707(b) of the Code (substituting &ldquo;20%&rdquo; for the phrase &ldquo;50%&rdquo;); (ii)
there are no plans, arrangements, or agreements that effectively require or are intended to compel the issuer to redeem the stock;
and (iii) exercise of the right to redeem would not reduce the yield on the stock determined using principles applicable to the
determination of OID under the OID Rules. The fact that a redemption right is not within the safe harbor described in the preceding
sentence does not mean that an issuer&rsquo;s right to redeem is more likely than not to occur and the issuer&rsquo;s right to
redeem must still be tested under all the facts and circumstances to determine if it is more likely than not to occur. We do not
believe that a redemption pursuant to the call option should be treated as more likely than not to occur under the foregoing test.
Accordingly, no U.S. holder of the Series A Preferred Stock should be required to recognize constructive distributions of the redemption
premium because of our call option.</P>

shares actually owned by you, must generally be taken into account. If you do not own (actually or constructively) any additional
Series A Preferred Stock or our common stock, or own only an insubstantial percentage of our stock, and do not participate in our
control or management, a redemption of your Series A Preferred Stock will generally qualify for sale or exchange treatment. Otherwise,
the redemption may be taxable as a dividend to the extent of our current or accumulated earnings and profits as discussed above
with respect to distributions generally. Because the determination as to whether any of the alternative tests of Section 302(b)
of the Code will be satisfied with respect to any particular U.S. holder depends upon the facts and circumstances at the time that
the determination must be made, prospective U.S. holders are advised to consult their own tax advisors regarding the tax treatment
of a redemption. If a redemption of Series A Preferred Stock is treated as an exchange, it will be taxable as described in the
preceding paragraph. If a redemption is treated as a distribution, the entire amount received will be treated as a distribution
and will be taxable as described under the caption &ldquo;&mdash;<I>Distributions in General</I>&rdquo; above.</P>

the Series A Preferred Stock will be subject to withholding of U.S. federal income tax at a 30% rate or such lower rate as may
be specified by an applicable income tax treaty. However, dividends that are effectively connected with the conduct of a trade
or business by the Non-U.S. holder within the United States (and, where a tax treaty applies, are attributable to a permanent establishment
maintained by the Non-U.S. holder in the United States) are not subject to the withholding tax, provided that certain certification
and disclosure requirements are satisfied including completing Internal Revenue Service Form W-8ECI (or other applicable form).
Instead, such dividends are subject to U.S. federal income tax on a net income basis in the same manner as if the Non-U.S. holder
were a United States person as defined under the Code, unless an applicable income tax treaty provides otherwise. Any such effectively
connected dividends received by a foreign corporation may be subject to an additional &ldquo;branch profits tax&rdquo; at a 30%
rate or such lower rate as may be specified by an applicable income tax treaty. A Non-U.S. holder of the Series A Preferred Stock
who wishes to claim the benefit of an applicable treaty rate and avoid backup withholding, as discussed below, for dividends will
be required to (i) complete Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN or Form W-8BEN-E (or other applicable form) and certify under
penalty of perjury that such holder is not a United States person as defined under the Code and is eligible for treaty benefits,
or (ii) if the Series A Preferred Stock is held through certain foreign intermediaries, satisfy the relevant certification requirements
of applicable Treasury regulations. A Non-U.S. holder of the Series A Preferred Stock eligible for a reduced rate of U.S. withholding
tax pursuant to an income tax treaty may obtain a refund of any excess amounts withheld by timely filing an appropriate claim for
refund with the Internal Revenue Service.</P>

is a corporation, may also be subject to the branch profits tax equal to 30% of its effectively connected earnings and profits
or at such lower rate as may be specified by an applicable income tax treaty. An individual Non-U.S. holder described in the second
bullet point immediately above will be subject to a flat 30% tax (or at such reduced rate as may be provided by an applicable treaty)
on the gain derived from the sale, which may be offset by U.S. source capital losses, even though the individual is not considered
a resident of the United States. A Non-U.S. holder described in the third bullet point above will be subject to U.S. federal income
tax under regular U.S. federal income tax rates with respect to the gain recognized in the same manner as if the Non-U.S. holder
were a United States person as defined under the Code. If a Non-U.S. holder is subject to U.S. federal income tax on any sale,
exchange, redemption (except as discussed below), or other disposition of the Series A Preferred Stock, such a Non-U.S. holder
will recognize capital gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized by the Non-U.S. holder and the Non-U.S.
holder&rsquo;s adjusted tax basis in the Series A Preferred Stock. Such capital gain or loss will be long-term capital gain or
loss if the Non-U.S. holder&rsquo;s holding period for the Series A Preferred Stock is longer than one year. A Non-U.S. holder
should consult its own tax advisors with respect to applicable tax rates and netting rules for capital gains and losses. Certain
limitations exist on the deduction of capital losses by both corporate and non-corporate taxpayers. The receipt of any redemption
proceeds attributable to any accrued but unpaid dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock generally will be subject to the rules
discussed above in &ldquo;<I>Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations &mdash; Non-U.S. Holders: Distributions on the Series

withholding may also be made available to the tax authorities in the country in which the Non-U.S. holder resides under the provisions

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">CSSE is a growing media company building online video on-demand
(&ldquo;VOD&rdquo;) networks that provide positive and entertaining video content for all screens. We also curate, produce and
distribute long and short-form video content that brings out the best of the human spirit, and distribute the online content of
our affiliate, A Plus. We are aggressively growing our business through a combination of organic growth, licensing and distribution
arrangements, acquisitions and strategic relationships. We are also expanding our partnerships with sponsors, television networks
and independent producers. Our subsidiary, Screen Media, is a leading global independent television and film distribution company,
which owns one of the largest independently owned television and film libraries. We also own Popcornflix<SUP>&reg;</SUP>, a popular
online advertiser-supported VOD (&ldquo;AVOD&rdquo;) network, Pivotshare, a subscription-based VOD, and four additional AVOD networks,
which collectively have rights to exhibit tens of thousands of hours of movies and television episodes.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">Since our inception in January 2015, our business has grown
rapidly. For the full year 2017, our audited net revenue was $10.7 million, as compared to 2016 audited net revenue for the full
year of $8.1 million. For the six months ended June 30, 2018, our net revenue was $8.7 million, as compared to net revenue for
the six months ended June 30, 2017 of $2.2 million. These increases were primarily due to the acquisition of Screen Media in November
2017. We had audited net income of $22.8 million for the full year 2017, as compared to a full year audited net income of $0.8
million in 2016. The full year 2017 included a gain on bargain purchase of $24.3 million and acquisition-related expenses of $2.2
million relating to the acquisition of Screen Media, as discussed in the 2017 10-K under the section entitled &ldquo;<I>Management&rsquo;s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&mdash;Recent Developments&mdash;Acquisition of Screen
Media.</I>&rdquo;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">Our 2017 unaudited Adjusted EBITDA was $4.0 million for the
full year, as compared to full year 2016 unaudited Adjusted EBITDA of $3.8 million. For the six months ended June 30, 2018, our
unaudited Adjusted EBITDA was $2.1 million, as compared to unaudited Adjusted EBITDA for the six months ended June 30, 2017 of

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">To date we have reported the vast majority of our revenue and
net income in the fourth quarter of each year. We have begun to sign some sponsorship contracts for 2018 and subsequent years,
and are beginning production of some series, earlier in the year than in recent years. This has resulted in more balanced revenue
across the third quarter of 2018, and should continue to result in more balanced revenue across the fourth quarter of 2018 and
subsequent years. Additionally, revenue from both our online networks and television and film distribution business areas are more
evenly spaced through the year, which should result in more balanced revenue, net income and Adjusted EBITDA going forward across
all quarters of each year. While the operating results in these areas are expected to be more evenly distributed over fiscal quarters,
the fourth quarter is generally the strongest quarter and the second quarter is generally the weakest quarter.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">Our vision is to use our solid core of traditional media production
and distribution assets to build a powerful portfolio of online VOD networks and assets. Our production and distribution businesses
generate current revenue and Adjusted EBITDA to fund our rapidly growing online networks. We will build and acquire assets such
as content libraries, digital publishers with content related to our own, and stand-alone VOD networks.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">One of our fundamental objectives is to continue to grow our
VOD networks to create a &ldquo;network of networks&rdquo; as we continue to grow our content offerings to critical mass. Our strategy
is to build our library of video content through a combination of Chicken Soup for the Soul original video content and opportunistic
acquisitions of third-party video content libraries, such as our transformative acquisition of Screen Media, or other rights to
video content as distressed networks seek to monetize their content libraries. We now own exhibition or distribution rights to
over 34,000 hours of programming across our various platforms.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">Our acquisition of Screen Media accelerated our entry into the
direct-to-consumer VOD market through Popcornflix<SUP>&reg;</SUP>. Popcornflix<SUP>&reg;</SUP> has an extensive footprint with
apps that have been downloaded by more than 25 million smartphones and other devices using iOS, Android and other operating systems.
Popcornflix<SUP>&reg;</SUP> had 15 million active users in 2018.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">Popcornflix<SUP>&reg;</SUP> is one of the largest AVOD services.
Under the Popcornflix<SUP>&reg;</SUP> brand, we operate a series of direct-to consumer advertising supported channels. On Popcornflix<SUP>&reg;</SUP>,
we have the rights to exhibit more than 3,000 films and approximately 60 television series comprised of approximately 1,500 episodes,

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">Our entry into subscription-based VOD was recently initiated
by our acquisition of the Pivotshare VOD network in August 2018. Pivotshare is comprised of a series of subscription-based VOD
channels with 28,000 hours of programming. The network generates approximately $2.5 million in gross billings and has approximately
25,000 paid subscriptions with  average monthly billings of $9 per subscription.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">In addition to Popcornflix<SUP>&reg;</SUP> and Pivotshare, we
derive online networks revenue from our exclusive distribution relationship with A Plus, our affiliate, which develops and distributes
high-quality, empathetic short-form videos and articles to millions of people worldwide. Our distribution relationship with A Plus
allows us to accelerate the growth of our video library by providing us with content developed and distributed by A Plus that is
complementary to the Brand.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">We distribute television series and films worldwide through
Screen Media. We own the copyright or long-term distribution rights to approximately 3,500 hours of television series and feature
films, representing one of the largest independently owned libraries of filmed entertainment in the world. We distribute our television
series and films through direct relationships across all media, including theatrical, home video, pay-per-view, free, cable and
pay television, VOD and emerging digital media platforms worldwide.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">Screen Media&rsquo;s distribution capabilities across all media
will allow us to distribute our produced television series directly and eliminate the distribution fees (as much as 30% of revenue)
that we currently pay to third parties for distribution of the rights we retain when we produce series with our sponsors. We believe
that the cost savings from Screen Media&rsquo;s distribution capabilities will enhance our revenue and profits from our produced
television series.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">The Company has distribution licensing agreements with numerous
VOD services across all major platforms, such as cable and satellite VOD and Internet VOD, which includes TVOD for rentals or purchases
of films, AVOD for free-to-viewer streaming of films supported by advertisements and SVOD for unlimited access to films for a monthly
fee.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">Our cable and satellite VOD distribution agreements include

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">We utilize the <I>Chicken Soup for the Soul </I>brand, together
with our management&rsquo;s industry experience and expertise, to generate revenue through the production and distribution of video
content. The Company partners with sponsors and uses highly-regarded independent producers to develop and produce video content.
Using this approach provides us with access to a diverse pool of creative ideas for new video content projects and allows us to
scale our business on a variable cost basis. We currently have producer agreements or arrangements in place with a number of these
producers, including Litton Entertainment (a Hearst company). We anticipate entering into relationships with additional independent
producers.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">We seek committed funding from corporate and foundation sponsors
covering more than the production costs prior to moving forward with a project. Since we seek to secure both the committed funding
and production capabilities for our video content prior to moving forward with a project, we have high visibility into the profitability
of a particular project before committing to proceed with such project. In addition, we take limited financial risk on developing
our projects.</P>

on the road; an over-protective dad struggles with his autistic daughter&rsquo;s growing independence; and gay dads deal with the

are highly competitive businesses. We face competition from companies within the entertainment business and from alternative forms
of leisure entertainment, such as travel, sporting events, outdoor recreation, video games, the internet and other cultural and

television networks, pay television systems and online media platforms for the services of performing artists, producers and other
creative and technical personnel, and production financing, all of which are essential to the success of our businesses.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">We are a Delaware corporation formed on May 4, 2016. CSS Productions,
our predecessor and immediate parent company, was formed in December 2014 by CSS, and initiated operations in January 2015. We
were formed to create a discrete entity focused on video content opportunities using the Brand. In May 2016, pursuant to the terms
of the contribution agreement among CSS, CSS Productions and the Company (the &ldquo;CSS Contribution Agreement&rdquo;), all video
content assets (the &ldquo;Subject Assets&rdquo;) owned by CSS, CSS Productions and their CSS subsidiaries were transferred to
the Company in consideration for its issuance to CSS Productions of 8,600,568 shares of the Company&rsquo;s Class B common stock.
Since the date of the CSS Contribution Agreement, CSS Productions has transferred certain of these shares of Class&nbsp;B common
stock to third parties and certain of these shares of Class B Common Stock have been converted into Class A Common Stock at the
election of the holders thereof. Concurrently with the consummation of the CSS Contribution Agreement, certain rights to receive
payments under certain agreements comprising part of the Subject Assets owned by Trema, LLC (&ldquo;Trema&rdquo;), a company principally
owned and controlled by William J. Rouhana, Jr., the Company&rsquo;s chairman and chief executive officer, were assigned to the
Company under a contribution agreement (the &ldquo;Trema Contribution Agreement&rdquo;) in consideration for the Company&rsquo;s
issuance to Trema of 159,432 shares or our Class B common stock. Thereafter, CSS Productions&rsquo; operating activities ceased,
and the Company continued the business operations of producing and distributing the video content.</P>

dividends, cumulative cash dividends at the rate of 9.75% of the $25.00 per share liquidation preference per annum (equivalent
to $2.4375 per annum per share). Dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock shall be payable monthly on the 15th day of each month;
provided that if any dividend payment date is not a business day, as defined in the certificate of designations, then the dividend
that would otherwise have been payable on that dividend payment date may be paid on the next succeeding business day and no interest,
additional dividends or other sums will accrue on the amount so payable for the period from and after that dividend payment date

partial dividend period, will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months; however, the shares
of Series A Preferred Stock offered hereby will be credited as having accrued dividends since the first day of the calendar month

Stock at the close of business on the applicable record date, which shall be the last day of the calendar month, whether or not
a business day, immediately preceding the month in which the applicable dividend payment date falls. As a result, holders of shares

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">When you purchase shares of Series A Preferred Stock within
the DTC system, the purchase must be by or through a Direct Participant. The Direct Participant will receive a credit for the Series
A Preferred Stock on DTC&rsquo;s records. You will be considered to be the &ldquo;beneficial owner&rdquo; of the Series A Preferred
Stock. Your beneficial ownership interest will be recorded on the Direct and Indirect Participants&rsquo; records, but DTC will
have no knowledge of your individual ownership. DTC&rsquo;s records reflect only the identity of the Direct Participants to whose
accounts shares of Series A Preferred Stock are credited.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">You will not receive written confirmation from DTC of your purchase.
The Direct or Indirect Participants through whom you purchased the Series A Preferred Stock should send you written confirmations
providing details of your transactions, as well as periodic statements of your holdings. The Direct and Indirect Participants are
responsible for keeping an accurate account of the holdings of their customers like you.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">Transfers of ownership interests held through Direct and Indirect
Participants will be accomplished by entries on the books of Direct and Indirect Participants acting on behalf of the beneficial
owners.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">Conveyance of notices and other communications by DTC to Direct
Participants, by Direct Participants to Indirect Participants, and by Direct Participants and Indirect Participants to beneficial
owners will be governed by arrangements among them, subject to any statutory or regulatory requirements as may be in effect from
time to time.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">We understand that, under DTC&rsquo;s existing practices, in
the event that we request any action of the holders, or an owner of a beneficial interest in a global security, such as you, desires
to take any action that a holder is entitled to take under our amended and restated certificate of incorporation (including the
certificate of designations designating the Series A Preferred Stock), DTC would authorize the Direct Participants holding the
relevant shares to take such action, and those Direct Participants and any Indirect Participants would authorize beneficial owners
owning through those Direct and Indirect Participants to take such action or would otherwise act upon the instructions of beneficial
owners owning through them.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">Any redemption notices with respect to the Series A Preferred
Stock will be sent to Cede &amp; Co. If less than all of the outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock are being redeemed,
DTC will reduce each Direct Participant&rsquo;s holdings of shares of Series A Preferred Stock in accordance with its procedures.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">In those instances where a vote is required, neither DTC nor
Cede &amp; Co. itself will consent or vote with respect to the shares of Series A Preferred Stock. Under its usual procedures,
DTC would mail an omnibus proxy to us as soon as possible after the record date. The omnibus proxy assigns Cede &amp; Co.&rsquo;s
consenting or voting rights to those Direct Participants whose accounts the shares of Series A Preferred Stock are credited to
on the record date, which are identified in a listing attached to the omnibus proxy.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">Dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock are made directly
to DTC&rsquo;s nominee (or its successor, if applicable). DTC&rsquo;s practice is to credit participants&rsquo; accounts on the
relevant payment date in accordance with their respective holdings shown on DTC&rsquo;s records unless DTC has reason to believe
that it will not receive payment on that payment date.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">Payments by Direct and Indirect Participants to beneficial owners
will be governed by standing instructions and customary practices, as is the case with securities held for the accounts of customers
in bearer form or registered in &ldquo;street name.&rdquo; These payments will be the responsibility of the participant and not
of DTC, us or any agent of ours.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">DTC may discontinue providing its services as securities depositary
with respect to the Series A Preferred Stock at any time by giving reasonable notice to us. Additionally, we may decide to discontinue
the book-entry only system of transfers with respect to the Series A Preferred Stock. In that event, we will print and deliver
certificates in fully registered form for the Series A Preferred Stock. If DTC notifies us that it is unwilling to continue as
securities depositary, or it is unable to continue or ceases to be a clearing agency registered under the Exchange Act and a successor
depositary is not appointed by us within 90 days after receiving such notice or becoming aware that DTC is no longer so registered,
we will issue the Series A Preferred Stock in definitive form, at our expense, upon registration of transfer of, or in exchange
for, such global security.</P>

ours will be personally liable to us or any of our stockholders for monetary damages arising from the director&rsquo;s breach of
fiduciary duty as a director. However, this does not apply with respect to any action in which the director would be liable under
Section 174 of the DGCL nor does it apply with respect to any liability in which the director (i) breached his duty of loyalty
to us or our stockholders; (ii) did not act in good faith or, in failing to act, did not act in good faith; (iii) acted in a manner
involving intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law or, in failing to act, shall have acted in a manner involving intentional
misconduct or a knowing violation of law; or (iv) derived an improper personal benefit. This provision could have the effect of
reducing the likelihood of derivative litigation against our directors and may discourage or deter our stockholders or management
from bringing a lawsuit against our directors for breach of their duty of care, even though such an action, if successful, might
otherwise have benefited us and our stockholders.</P>

if authorized by our board of directors, we may indemnify any other person whom it has the power to indemnify under section 145
of the DGCL. We have entered, and intend to continue to enter, into separate indemnification agreements with our directors and
executive officers, in addition to the indemnification provided for in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws. We also maintain

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">Provisions of the DGCL and our certificate of incorporation
and bylaws could make it more difficult to acquire us by means of a tender offer, a proxy contest or otherwise, or to remove incumbent
officers and directors. These provisions, summarized below, are expected to discourage certain types of coercive takeover practices
and takeover bids that our board of directors may consider inadequate and to encourage persons seeking to acquire control of us
to first negotiate with our board of directors. We believe that the benefits of increased protection of our ability to negotiate
with the proponent of an unfriendly or unsolicited proposal to acquire or restructure us outweigh the disadvantages of discouraging
takeover or acquisition proposals because, among other things, negotiation of these proposals could result in improved terms for
our stockholders.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">We are subject to Section 203 of the DGCL, an anti-takeover
statute. In general, Section 203 of the DGCL prohibits a publicly-held Delaware corporation from engaging in a &ldquo;business
combination&rdquo; with an &ldquo;interested stockholder&rdquo; for a period of three years following the time the person became
an interested stockholder, unless the business combination or the acquisition of shares that resulted in a stockholder becoming
an interested stockholder is approved in a prescribed manner. Generally, a &ldquo;business combination&rdquo; includes a merger,
asset or stock sale, or other transaction resulting in a financial benefit to the interested stockholder. Generally, an &ldquo;interested
stockholder&rdquo; is a person who, together with affiliates and associates, owns (or within three years prior to the determination
of interested stockholder status did own) 15% or more of a corporation&rsquo;s voting stock. The existence of this provision would
be expected to have an anti-takeover effect with respect to transactions not approved in advance by the board of directors, including
discouraging attempts that might result in a premium over the market price for the shares of common stock held by stockholders.</P>
