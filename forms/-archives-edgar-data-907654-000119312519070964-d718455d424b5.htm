<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>The terms “ARCA,” “the Company,” “we,” “us,” “our” and similar terms refer to ARCA biopharma, Inc.
</I></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Company Overview </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We are a biopharmaceutical
company applying a precision medicine approach to developing genetically-targeted therapies for cardiovascular diseases. Precision medicine refers to the tailoring of medical treatment to the individual characteristics of each patient through the
ability to classify individuals into subpopulations that differ in their susceptibility to a particular disease, in the biology and/or prognosis of those diseases they may develop, or in their response to a specific treatment. Our lead product
candidate, Gencaro™ (bucindolol hydrochloride), is an investigational, pharmacologically unique beta-blocker and mild vasodilator that we are developing to treat atrial fibrillation, or AF, in certain patients who also have heart failure, or
HF. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Gencaro has a mechanism of action that we believe is unique in the beta-blocker drug class and is modulated by a specific genotype. We estimate this
genotype is present in about 50% of North American and European general populations. We believe that Gencaro’s potential efficacy is enhanced in treating patients who have this genotype and, if Gencaro is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration, or the FDA, Gencaro could potentially be a safe and effective therapy for treating AF in patients who have HF. We also believe that Gencaro, if approved, will have market exclusivity based on patents and new chemical entity status,
if approved in the United States, Europe or other markets. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In February 2019, we received a Special Protocol Assessment, or SPA, agreement with the FDA in
support of our planned Phase 3 clinical program. The FDA’s SPA process is designed to facilitate the FDA’s review and approval of drugs by allowing the FDA to evaluate the proposed design and size of certain clinical trials that are
intended to form the primary basis for determining a drug product’s efficacy and safety. Upon specific request by a clinical trial sponsor, the FDA evaluates the protocol and responds to a sponsor’s questions regarding, among other things,
primary efficacy endpoints, trial conduct and data analysis, within 45 days of receipt of the request. The FDA ultimately assesses whether the protocol design and planned analysis of the trial are acceptable to support regulatory approval of the
product candidate for the indication studied. An SPA agreement can potentially reduce the regulatory risk of bringing a drug to market. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">To support the
continued development of Gencaro, including the planned <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">PRECISION-AF</FONT> clinical trial, we will need additional financing to fund the Phase 3 trial and our general and administrative costs through its projected
completion. Considering the substantial time and costs associated with the development of Gencaro and the risk that we may be unable to raise a significant amount of capital on acceptable terms, we may also pursue partnering and licensing
opportunities, a strategic combination or other strategic transactions. If we are delayed in obtaining financing or are unable to complete a strategic transaction, we may discontinue our development activities on Gencaro or discontinue our
operations.</P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We believe our cash and cash equivalents balance as of December&nbsp;31, 2018, together with the $2.4&nbsp;million of net proceeds raised in
2019 from sales of our common stock, will be sufficient to fund our operations, at our current cost structure, through the third quarter of 2019. However, changing circumstances may cause us to consume capital significantly faster or slower than we
currently anticipate. We have based these estimates on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could exhaust our available financial resources sooner than we currently anticipate. </P>

such sales agreement, as amended, for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $12.6&nbsp;million. Net proceeds received in the period were approximately $11.9&nbsp;million, after deducting initial expenses for executing the “at the market

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Investing in our common stock involves significant risks, some of which are described below. You should carefully consider these risks, as well as the
other information in this prospectus supplement, accompanying prospectus and any free writing prospectus authorized in connection with this offering, including documents incorporated by reference, such as our most recent annual report on Form <FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">10-K</FONT> and quarterly reports on Form <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">10-Q</FONT> filed with the SEC, and in other documents that we have filed or subsequently file with the SEC that are incorporated by reference,
before deciding whether to invest in our common stock. Each of the risk factors could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition, as well as adversely affect the value of an investment in our securities, and the
occurrence of any of these risks might cause you to lose all or part of your investment. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may also significantly impair our business operations. Please also read
carefully the section below titled “Forward-Looking Statements.” </I></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Additional Risks Related to this Offering </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>If you purchase our common stock in this offering, you may incur immediate dilution in the book value of your investment. </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The offering price per share in this offering may exceed the net tangible book value per share of our common stock outstanding prior to this offering. Assuming
that an aggregate of 1,350,723 shares of our common stock are sold at a price of $0.4299 per share, the last reported sale price of our common stock on the Exchange on March&nbsp;8, 2019, for aggregate gross proceeds of $580,676, and after deducting
commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us, you would experience nominal dilution per share, because there is minimal difference between our as adjusted net tangible book value per share as December&nbsp;31, 2018 after giving effect
to this offering and the assumed offering price. Yet, if we were to sell shares of our common stock in this offering at a price per share greater than our net tangible book value, it would result in dilution of your investment. The exercise of
outstanding stock options and warrants or the settlement of outstanding restricted stock units would result in further dilution of your investment. See the section entitled “Dilution” below for a more detailed illustration of the dilution
you may incur if you participate in this offering. Because the sales of the shares offered hereby will be made directly into the market or in negotiated transactions, the prices at which we sell these shares will vary and these variations may be
significant. Purchasers of the shares we sell, as well as our existing shareholders, will experience significant dilution if we sell shares at prices significantly below the price at which they invested. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Future sales or the possibility of future sales of our common stock may depress the market price of our common stock. </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Sales in the public market of substantial amounts of our common stock could depress prevailing market prices of our common stock. As of December&nbsp;31, 2018,
approximately 13.9&nbsp;million shares of common stock were outstanding, and all of these shares are freely transferable without restriction or further registration under the Securities Act, except for shares held by our directors, officers and
other affiliates and unregistered shares held by <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-affiliates.</FONT> The sale of these additional shares, or the perception that such sales may occur, could depress the market price of our common stock. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As of December&nbsp;31, 2018, approximately 2.7&nbsp;million shares of our common stock were issuable upon the exercise of outstanding warrants. Once a
warrant is exercised, if the shares of our common stock issued upon the exercise of any such warrant are not available for sale in the open market without further registration under the Securities Act, then the holder can arrange for the resale of
shares either by invoking any applicable registration rights, causing the shares to be registered under the Securities Act and thus freely transferable, or by relying on an exemption to the Securities Act. For instance, in July 2015, we filed a
registration statement on Form <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">S-3</FONT> which registered for resale an aggregate of 2.4&nbsp;million shares of our common stock issuable upon exercise of outstanding warrants. If these registration rights, or
similar registration rights that may apply to securities we may issue in the future, are exercised, it could result in additional sales of our common stock in the market, which may have an adverse effect on our stock price. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As of December&nbsp;31, 2018, there were approximately 604,000 shares of our common stock which may be issued upon the exercise of outstanding stock options
and the settlement of restricted stock units, and we anticipate that we will continue to issue stock option and restricted stock unit awards to our employees and consultants in the fiscal year ended December&nbsp;31,&nbsp;2019 and thereafter. If and
when these options are exercised and these restricted stock units are vested, such shares will be available for sale in the open market without further registration under the Securities Act. The existence of these outstanding options and restricted
stock units may negatively affect our ability to complete future equity financings at acceptable prices and on acceptable terms. The exercise of those options and settlement of the restricted stock units, and the prompt resale of shares of our
common stock received, may also result in downward pressure on the price of our common stock. </P>

acquisition proposals and to discourage certain tactics that may be used in proxy fights. These provisions, however, could also have the effect of discouraging others from making tender offers for our shares. As a consequence, they also may inhibit
fluctuations in the market price of our shares that could result from actual or rumored takeover attempts. Such provisions also may have the effect of preventing changes in our management. </P>

determined by dividing our total tangible assets, less total liabilities, by the number of shares of our common stock outstanding as of December&nbsp;31, 2018. Dilution with respect to net tangible book value per share represents the difference
between the amount per share paid by purchasers of shares of common stock in this offering and the net tangible book value per share of our common stock immediately after this offering. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On March&nbsp;11, 2019, we entered into an amendment (“Amendment No.&nbsp;3”) to Capital on Demand™ Sales Agreement, dated January&nbsp;11,
2017, as amended on August&nbsp;21, 2017 and January&nbsp;25, 2019 (the “Original Agreement” and together with Amendment No.&nbsp;3, the “Sales Agreement”) with JonesTrading, pursuant to which we may, from time to time, offer and
sell shares of our common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $13,323,415. Sales of our common stock, if any, under this prospectus supplement and accompanying prospectus may be made in sales deemed to be “at the market
offerings” as defined in Rule 415 promulgated under the Securities Act. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As a result of the limitations discussed below and the current public float
of our common stock, and in accordance with the terms of the Sales Agreement, we may offer and sell shares of our common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $580,676 from time to time through or to JonesTrading, as sales agent or
principal. Pursuant to General Instruction I.B.6 of Form <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">S-3,</FONT> in no event will we sell securities registered on the registration statement of which this prospectus supplement is a part in a public primary
offering with a value exceeding more than <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">one-third</FONT> of our public float in any <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">12-month</FONT> period if our public float, measured in accordance with such instruction, remains
below $75.0&nbsp;million. As of March&nbsp;8, 2019, the aggregate market value of our common stock held by <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-affiliates,</FONT> or the public float, was $9,241,455, which was calculated based on 18,191,841 shares
of our outstanding common stock held by <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-affiliates</FONT> as of the date of March&nbsp;8,&nbsp;2019 at a price of $0.508 per share, which was the closing price of our common stock on the Exchange on
February&nbsp;20,&nbsp;2019. As of the date hereof, we have sold 4,431,053 shares of our common stock, for aggregate proceeds of approximately $2.5&nbsp;million, pursuant to General Instruction I.B.6 of Form
<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">S-3</FONT> during the 12 calendar months prior to and including the date of this prospectus supplement. Sales of the shares of common stock, if any, may be made on the Exchange at market prices and such other sales
as agreed upon by us and JonesTrading. The Amendment No.&nbsp;3 has been filed as an exhibit to our Current Report on <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">Form&nbsp;8-K</FONT> filed with the SEC on March&nbsp;11, 2019. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Each time we wish to issue and sell common stock, we will notify JonesTrading of the number of shares to be issued, the dates on which such sales are
anticipated to be made, any minimum price below which sales may not be made and other sales parameters as we deem appropriate. Once we have so instructed JonesTrading, unless JonesTrading declines to accept the terms of the notice, JonesTrading has
agreed, subject to the terms and conditions of the Sales Agreement, to use its commercially reasonable efforts consistent with its normal trading and sales practices to sell such shares up to the amount specified on such terms. We may instruct
JonesTrading not to sell shares of common stock if the sales cannot be effected at or above the price designated by us in any such instruction. We or JonesTrading may suspend the offering of shares of common stock being made through JonesTrading
under the Sales Agreement upon proper notice to the other party. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We will pay JonesTrading commissions for its services in acting as agent in the sale of
our common stock. JonesTrading may effect sales to or through dealers, and such dealers may receive compensation in the form of discounts, concessions or commissions from JonesTrading and/or purchasers of shares of common stock for whom they may act
as agents or to whom they may sell as principal. JonesTrading will be entitled to compensation at a commission rate equal to 3.0% of the aggregate gross sales price of the shares sold. Because there is no minimum offering amount required as a
condition to close this offering, the actual total public offering amount, commissions and proceeds to us, if any, are not determinable at this time. We have also agreed to reimburse JonesTrading for certain specified expenses, including the fees
and disbursements of its legal counsel in an aggregate amount (inclusive of expenses paid in connection with entering into the Sales Agreement) not to exceed $65,000, as provided in the Sales Agreement. As of the effective date of the Amendment, the
Company has reimbursed $38,000 of such expenses to JonesTrading. We estimate that the total expenses for this offering (inclusive of expenses paid in connection with entering into the Sales Agreement), excluding compensation and reimbursements
payable to JonesTrading under the terms of the Sales Agreement, will be approximately $35,000. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Settlement for sales of common stock will occur on the
second business day following the date on which any sales are made or such earlier day as is industry practice for <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">regular-way</FONT> trading, or on some other date that is agreed upon by us and JonesTrading in
connection with a particular transaction, in return for payment of the net proceeds to us. There is no arrangement for funds to be received in an escrow, trust or similar arrangement. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In connection with the sale of the common stock on our behalf, JonesTrading will be deemed to be an “underwriter” within the meaning of the
Securities Act and the compensation of JonesTrading will be deemed to be underwriting commissions or discounts. We have agreed to provide indemnification and contribution to JonesTrading against certain civil liabilities, including liabilities under
the Securities Act. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Overview </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We are a biopharmaceutical company applying a
precision medicine approach to developing genetically-targeted therapies for cardiovascular diseases. Precision medicine refers to the tailoring of medical treatment to the individual characteristics of each patient through the ability to classify
individuals into subpopulations that differ in their susceptibility to a particular disease, in the biology and/or prognosis of those diseases they may develop, or in their response to a specific treatment. Our lead product candidate, Gencaro™
(bucindolol hydrochloride), is an investigational, pharmacologically unique beta-blocker and mild vasodilator that we are developing for the potential treatment of patients with atrial fibrillation, or AF, and chronic heart failure with reduced left
ventricular ejection fraction, or HFrEF. HFrEF constitutes an estimated <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">50-60%</FONT> of the total heart failure with the remainder comprised of HF with preserved ejection fraction. We believe that Gencaro’s
efficacy is enhanced in a specific genotype that is present in approximately fifty percent of the general population in the United States, and can be identified by a genetic test. We believe that with this genetic test, we may be able to predict
individual patient response to Gencaro, potentially improving the efficacy of treatment for AF in HFrEF patients with this particular genotype. We believe that Gencaro, if approved, could potentially be a safer and more effective therapy for
treating or preventing AF in patients with HFrEF and could be the first genetically-targeted AF treatment. We also believe that Gencaro may have market exclusivity based on patents and new chemical entity status, if approved in the United States,
Europe or other markets. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We are conducting a Phase 2B/Phase 3 clinical superiority trial, known as <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">GENETIC-AF,</FONT> in
which we are evaluating Gencaro for the treatment and prevention of AF in HFrEF patients. In our trial, HFrEF is defined as a left ventricular ejection fraction, or LVEF, of less than 50%. <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">GENETIC-AF</FONT> compares
Gencaro to <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">TOPROL-XL</FONT> (metoprolol succinate), a drug approved for treating HFrEF that is also prescribed, but not approved, for treating AF in patients with HFrEF. Enrollment in
<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">GENETIC-AF</FONT> is limited to patients that possess the specific genotype that we believe enhances Gencaro’s potential therapeutic effects. Our current development of Gencaro is, in part, based on a
prospectively designed DNA substudy of adrenergic receptor polymorphisms in the BEST trial, a previous Phase 3 study of 2,708 HF patients. Based on data from the BEST trial, Gencaro showed potential evidence of enhanced efficacy in treating AF and
in reducing mortality and hospitalizations in HF patients with this specific genotype. In 2015, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, designated the investigation of Gencaro for the prevention of AF in a genetically targeted heart failure
population (HF patients with reduced LVEF) as a&nbsp;Fast Track development program. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">AF, the most common sustained cardiac arrhythmia, is a potentially
serious disorder in which the normally regular and coordinated contraction pattern of the heart’s two small upper chambers, or the atria, becomes irregular, rapid and uncoordinated. AF commonly occurs together with HFrEF, with AF being both a
cause and a result of HFrEF. By increasing heart rate and producing irregular cycle lengths, AF may contribute to the disease processes that leads to the progression of HFrEF and worsening clinical outcomes. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">AF is considered an epidemic cardiovascular disease and a major public health burden. The estimated number of individuals with AF globally in 2010 was
33.5&nbsp;million. According to the 2017 American Heart Association report on Cardiovascular Disease, approximately 5.2&nbsp;million people in the United States had atrial fibrillation in 2015. Hospitalization rates for AF increased by 23% among
U.S. adults from 2000 to 2010 and hospitalizations account for the majority of the economic cost burden associated with AF. In a global registry of AF patients, the rates of heart failure (of all types) ranged from 33% in patients with paroxysmal
(episodes lasting 7 days or less) to 56% in patients with permanent AF. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We believe there is a significant need for drug therapies that are safe and effective for HFrEF patients
with AF, as the existing drug therapies for the treatment or prevention AF have certain safety disadvantages in HFrEF patients, such as toxic or cardiovascular adverse effects. Most of the approved drugs for AF are contra indicated or have warnings
in their prescribing information for such patients. Consequently, in the treatment and prevention of AF in HFrEF patients, we believe there is an unmet medical need for new treatments that have fewer side effects and are more effective than
currently available therapies. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We believe that data from the BEST trial indicate that Gencaro may have a genetically regulated effect in reducing or
preventing AF in HFrEF patients. A&nbsp;retrospective analysis of data from the BEST trial shows that all patients in the trial treated with Gencaro had a 41% reduction in the risk of new onset AF <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">(time-to-event)</FONT></FONT> compared to placebo (p = 0.0004). In a substudy in the trial, which considered only patients with the genotype believed to enhance Gencaro’s efficacy (known as the <FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">beta-1</FONT> 389 arginine homozygous genotype), patients treated with Gencaro experienced a 74% (p = 0.0003) reduction in risk of AF, based on the same analysis. In addition, the BEST study, the <FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">beta-1</FONT> 389 arginine homozygous genotype Gencaro demonstrated enhanced efficacy in reducing mortality, hospitalizations, and ventricular tachycardia /ventricular fibrillation. Furthermore, patients with a <FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">beta-1&nbsp;389</FONT> arginine homozygous genotype who entered the trial in AF had statistically significant reductions in major cardiovascular or HF mortality/hospitalization composite endpoints, which we believe is the
first and thus far only demonstration of effectiveness of a beta-blocker in reducing major HF events in HFrEF patients with permanent AF. We believe that in HFrEF patients, the therapeutic efficacy of
<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">TOPROL-XL</FONT> is not enhanced in patients with a <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">beta-1</FONT> 389 arginine homozygous genotype, and we believe that Gencaro may be potentially unique in the beta-blocker class of
drugs due to its apparent pharmacologic interaction with this <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">beta-1</FONT> adrenergic receptor polymorphism. The <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">beta-1</FONT> 389 arginine homozygous genotype was present in about
47% of the patients in the BEST pharmacogenetic substudy, and we estimate it is present in about 50% of the U.S. general population. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">GENETIC-AF</FONT> is an adaptive, seamless design Phase 2B/Phase 3, multi-center, randomized, double-blind, clinical superiority trial comparing the safety and efficacy of Gencaro against an active comparator, the
beta-blocker <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">TOPROL-XL</FONT> (metoprolol succinate), that seeks to enroll a combined total of approximately 620 patients. Eligible patients will have HFrEF, a history of paroxysmal AF (episodes lasting 7 days or
less) or persistent AF (episodes lasting more than 7 days and less than 1 year) in the past 6 months, and the <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">beta-1</FONT> 389 arginine homozygous genotype that we believe responds most favorably to Gencaro.&nbsp;A
subset of patients in the trial will also undergo continuous heart rhythm monitoring to assess AF burden, which is defined as the amount of time per day that a patient experiences AF. These data will be collected via newly or previously implanted
Medtronic, Inc. devices capable of assessing AF burden (for example, implantable loop recorders, pacemakers, cardioverter-defibrillators, or cardiac resynchronization therapy devices).&nbsp;The primary endpoint of the study is time to first event of
symptomatic AF/atrial flutter, or AFL, or <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">all-cause</FONT> mortality.&nbsp;The combined Phase 2B/Phase 3 trial is designed for 90&nbsp;percent power at a <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">p-value</FONT> of less than
0.01 significance level to detect a 25&nbsp;percent reduction in the primary endpoint for patients in the Gencaro arm compared to patients in the <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">TOPROL-XL</FONT> arm. We received guidance from the FDA regarding the <FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">GENETIC-AF</FONT> clinical trial prior to initiation of the trial. Based on this FDA guidance, we believe that a successful <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">GENETIC-AF</FONT> Phase 3 clinical trial, with a <FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">p-value</FONT> of less than or equal to&nbsp;0.01 could be sufficient evidence of efficacy upon which to base a New Drug Application when submitted with the prior Phase 3 BEST trial data, for the approval of Gencaro for an
AF indication in HFrEF patients. A second trial may be required if the <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">GENETIC-AF</FONT> trial results produce a <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">p-value</FONT> greater than 0.01. The trial is currently enrolling
patients in the United States, Canada and Europe. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">GENETIC-AF</FONT> Data and Safety Monitoring Board, or DSMB, will
perform a <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">pre-specified</FONT> interim analysis of unblinded efficacy data when at least 150 patients have evaluable data. A randomized patient has evaluable data either when they experience their first composite
endpoint event, AF/AFL or <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">all-cause</FONT> mortality, or after completion of the <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">24-week</FONT> primary endpoint <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">follow-up</FONT> period. The analysis
will be conducted for detection of evidence of safety and superior efficacy of Gencaro versus the active comparator, <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">TOPROL-XL.</FONT> </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The prospectively defined features of this analysis include an estimate of Gencaro effectiveness relative to <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">TOPROL-XL</FONT>
and&nbsp;an assessment of safety as characterized by adverse events. The relative benefit estimate will utilize Bayesian statistical methods to calculate the predictive probability of the Phase 3 patient cohort hazard ratio

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We, in collaboration with the <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">GENETIC-AF</FONT> Steering Committee, will determine the next steps for the trial based on the
DSMB recommendation from this interim analysis and on our available capital.&nbsp;The unblinded statistical data available to the DSMB will not be disclosed to us or the public. We randomized our 200th patient in the trial in April 2017. We project
that the outcome of the DSMB interim analysis and recommendation will be available in September of 2017. In February 2016, we amended the trial protocol to allow for up to 250 patients to be enrolled in the Phase&nbsp;2B portion of the trial, which
is intended to enable the study to continue enrolling patients while the DSMB interim analysis is underway. Should the DSMB recommend that the study continue to Phase&nbsp;3, the trial would continue enrolling to a total of approximately 620
patients (i.e., up to 250&nbsp;patients in Phase&nbsp;2B and 370 patients in Phase&nbsp;3), subject to our obtaining sufficient financing to fund the Phase&nbsp;3 portion of the trial. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In February 2016, the <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">GENETIC-AF</FONT> protocol was amended to simplify certain operational aspects of the trial. We believe
these modifications facilitated site recruitment and enrollment in existing trial sites and additional sites in European countries, where we are expanding the study to support both the latter portion of Phase 2B, as well as the potential Phase 3
portion of the trial.&nbsp;We believe inclusion of European investigative sites will also support potential European regulatory submissions and partnering activity.&nbsp;We received no objections from the FDA and Health Canada on the protocol
amendments prior to their implementation.&nbsp;As such, we believe that these changes do not fundamentally alter or impact previous regulatory agreements. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">GENETIC-AF</FONT> clinical trial of Gencaro requires a companion diagnostic test to identify the patient’s receptor
genotype.&nbsp;We have an agreement with Laboratory Corporation of America, or LabCorp, to provide the companion diagnostic test and services to support our <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">GENETIC-AF</FONT> trial.&nbsp;LabCorp has developed the
genetic test and obtained an Investigational Device Exemption from the FDA for the companion diagnostic test which is being used in our <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">GENETIC-AF</FONT> clinical trial.&nbsp;We retain all rights to the genetic test.
</P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Medtronic, Inc., or Medtronic, a global healthcare solutions company, is collaborating with us on the <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">GENETIC-AF</FONT>
trial. Under the collaboration with Medtronic, ARCA is conducting a substudy that includes continuous monitoring of the cardiac rhythms in a subset of patients enrolled during the trial, which is the basis for a supportive endpoint in the trial
known as AF burden. The collaboration is administered by a joint ARCA-Medtronic committee. Medtronic uses its proprietary CareLink System to collect and analyze the cardiac rhythm data from the implanted Medtronic devices and the data will be used
by the DSMB as part of the interim analysis. Medtronic will support the reimbursement process for U.S. patients enrolled in the Phase 2B portion, and will provide financial support of unreimbursed costs for a certain number of U.S. patients in the
Phase 2B portion up to a certain maximum amount per patient. If <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">GENETIC-AF</FONT> continues to Phase 3, we will continue to enroll additional patients, with Medtronic devices for monitoring and recording AF burden,
in the substudy. Medtronic will provide the agreed upon CareLink System cardiac rhythm data collection and analysis for the Phase 3 portion of the substudy and support the reimbursement process. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We have been granted patents in the United States, Europe, and other jurisdictions for methods of treating AF and HF patients with Gencaro based on genetic
testing. We believe our patent portfolio and new chemical entity exclusivity may provide market exclusivity for the indications of Gencaro that we may develop, into approximately 2030 or 2031 in the United States, Europe and other markets. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">To support the continued development of Gencaro, in June 2015, we completed a private placement that raised approximately $34.2&nbsp;million of net proceeds
as additional funds for the Phase 2B portion of the <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">GENETIC-AF</FONT> trial and to support our ongoing operations.&nbsp;We are seeking to enroll up to 250 HFrEF patients in the Phase 2B portion

December&nbsp;31, 2016, 9,082,366 shares of common stock were outstanding and no shares of preferred stock were outstanding. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The following summary
description of our capital stock is based on the provisions of our Restated Certificate, our second amended and restated bylaws, or the Bylaws, and applicable provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law. This information may not be complete
in all respects and is qualified entirely by reference to the applicable provisions of our Restated Certificate, our Bylaws and the Delaware General Corporation Law. For information on how to obtain copies of our Restated Certificate and Bylaws,

including the election of directors; provided, however, holders of our common stock may not, unless otherwise required by law, vote on any amendment to our Restated Certificate that relates solely to the terms of one or more series of preferred
stock that we may issue if the holders of such preferred stock are entitled to vote on such amendment. In all such matters other than the election of directors, the affirmative vote of the majority of shares present in person, by remote
communication, or represented by proxy at a meeting of the stockholders and entitled to vote generally on the subject matter shall be the act of the stockholders. Directors shall be elected by a plurality of the votes of the shares present in
person, by remote communication, or represented by proxy at a meeting of the stockholders and entitled to vote generally on the election of directors. Our stockholders do not have cumulative voting rights in the election of directors. Accordingly,
holders of a majority of the voting shares are able to elect all of the directors to be elected at any particular time. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Dividends</I>. Subject to

assets legally available for distribution to stockholders after the payment of all of our debts and other liabilities and the satisfaction of any liquidation preference granted to the holders of any then outstanding shares of preferred stock. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Rights and Preferences</I>. Holders of our common stock have no preemptive, conversion, subscription or other rights, and there are no redemption
provisions applicable to our common stock. The rights, preferences and privileges of the holders of our common stock are subject to and may be adversely affected by the rights of the holders of shares of any series of our preferred stock that we may

redemption and repurchase, liquidation preferences and sinking fund terms, any or all of which may be greater than the rights of the common stock. Preferred stock may be convertible into our
common stock or other securities of ours, or may be exchangeable for debt securities. Conversion may be mandatory or at the holder’s option and would be at prescribed conversion rates. Because our board of directors, without stockholder
approval, can issue preferred stock with voting, conversion or other rights, preferred stock could be issued quickly with terms calculated to delay or prevent a change in control of our company or make removal of management more difficult.
Additionally, the issuance of preferred stock may have the effect of decreasing the market price of the common stock and may adversely affect the voting power of holders of common stock and reduce the likelihood that common stockholders will receive
dividend payments and payments upon liquidation. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The following is a summary of terms of our preferred stock. For a complete description, you should refer

series of preferred stock and described in any applicable prospectus supplement. Any applicable prospectus supplement may also state that any of the terms set forth herein are inapplicable to such series of preferred stock, provided that the
information set forth in such prospectus supplement does not constitute material changes to the information herein such that it alters the nature of the offering or the securities offered. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws </I></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our
Restated Certificate and Second Amended and Restated Bylaws, or Bylaws, include a number of provisions that may deter or impede hostile takeovers or changes of control or management. These provisions include: </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Issuance of Undesignated Preferred Stock</I>. Under our Restated Certificate, our board of directors has the authority, without further action by the
stockholders, to issue up to 5,000,000 shares of undesignated preferred stock with rights and preferences, including voting rights, designated from time to time by the board of directors. The existence of authorized but unissued shares of preferred
stock enables our board of directors to make it more difficult or to discourage an attempt to obtain control of us by means of a merger, tender offer, proxy contest or otherwise. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Classified Board</I>. Our Restated Certificate provides for a classified board of directors consisting of three classes of directors, with staggered
three-year terms. Only one class of directors will be elected at each annual meeting of our stockholders, with the other classes continuing for the remainder of their respective three-year terms. This provision may have the effect of delaying a
change in control of the board. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Board of Directors Vacancies</I>. Our Restated Certificate and Bylaws authorize only our board of directors to fill
vacant directorships, unless our board of directors determines by resolution that the stockholders shall fill such vacant directorships. In addition, the number of directors constituting our board of directors may be set only by resolution adopted
by a majority vote of our entire board of directors. These provisions prevent a stockholder from increasing the size of our board of directors and gaining control of our board of directors by filling the resulting vacancies with its own nominees.
</P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Stockholder Action; Special Meetings of Stockholders</I>. Our Restated Certificate provides that our stockholders may not take action by written
consent, but may only take action at annual or special meetings of our stockholders. Under our Bylaws, stockholders are not permitted to cumulate their votes for the election of directors. Our Bylaws further provide that special meetings of the
stockholders may be called by the chief executive officer, president, the board of directors, or by holders of common stock who hold, in the aggregate, not less than fifty percent (50%) of the outstanding shares of common stock for the purpose or
purposes stated in the call of the meeting. These provisions may prevent stockholders from corporate actions as stockholders at times when they otherwise would like to do so. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Advance Notice Requirements for Stockholder Proposals and Director Nominations</I>. Our Bylaws provide advance notice procedures for stockholders seeking
to bring business before our annual meeting of stockholders, or to nominate candidates for election as directors at our annual meeting of stockholders. Our Bylaws also specify certain requirements as to the form and content of a stockholder’s
notice. These provisions may make it more difficult for our stockholders to bring matters before our annual meeting of stockholders or to nominate directors at our annual meeting of stockholders. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">These provisions are intended to enhance the likelihood of continued stability in the composition of our board of directors and its policies and to discourage
certain types of transactions that may involve an actual or threatened acquisition of us. These provisions are designed to reduce our vulnerability to an unsolicited acquisition proposal. The provisions also are intended to discourage certain
tactics that may be used in proxy fights. However, these provisions could have the effect of discouraging others from making tender offers for our shares and, as a consequence, they may also reduce fluctuations in the market price of our shares that
could result from actual or rumored takeover attempts. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Section&nbsp;203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law </I></B></P>

While the terms we have summarized below will apply generally to any debt securities that we may offer under this prospectus, we will describe the particular terms of any debt securities that we may offer in more detail in the applicable prospectus
supplement. The terms of any debt securities offered under a prospectus supplement may differ from the terms described below. Unless the context requires otherwise, whenever we refer to the indenture, we also are referring to any supplemental
indentures that specify the terms of a particular series of debt securities. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We will issue the debt securities under the indenture that we will enter
into with the trustee named in the indenture. The indenture will be qualified under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended, or the Trust Indenture Act. We have filed the form of indenture as an exhibit to the registration statement of which
this prospectus is a part, and supplemental indentures and forms of debt securities containing the terms of the debt securities being offered will be filed as exhibits to the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part or will be
incorporated by reference from reports that we file with the SEC. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The following summary of material provisions of the debt securities and the indenture

securities that we may issue. It provides that we may issue debt securities up to the principal amount that we may authorize and may be in any currency or currency unit that we may designate. Except for the limitations on consolidation, merger and
sale of all or substantially all of our assets contained in the indenture, the terms of the indenture do not contain any covenants or other provisions designed to give holders of any debt securities protection against changes in our operations,
financial condition or transactions involving us. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We may issue the debt securities issued under the indenture as “discount securities,” which
means they may be sold at a discount below their stated principal amount. These debt securities, as well as other debt securities that are not issued at a discount, may be issued with “original issue discount,” or OID, for U.S. federal
income tax purposes because of interest payment and other characteristics or terms of the debt securities. Material U.S. federal income tax considerations applicable to debt securities issued with OID will be described in more detail in any

specifically set forth in the applicable indenture. Upon an event of default under an indenture, the trustee must use the same degree of care as a prudent person would exercise or use in the conduct of his or her own affairs. Subject to this
provision, the trustee is under no obligation to exercise any of the powers given it by the indenture at the request of any holder of debt securities unless it is offered reasonable security and indemnity against the costs, expenses and liabilities
that it might incur. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Payment and Paying Agents </B></P>

except that unless we otherwise indicate in the applicable prospectus supplement, we will make interest payments by check that we will mail to the holder or by wire transfer to certain holders. Unless we otherwise indicate in the applicable
prospectus supplement, we will designate the corporate trust office of the trustee as our sole paying agent for payments with respect to debt securities of each series. We will name in the applicable prospectus supplement any other paying agents
that we initially designate for the debt securities of a particular series. We will maintain a paying agent in each place of payment for the debt securities of a particular series. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">All money we pay to a paying agent or the trustee for the payment of the principal of or any premium or interest on any debt securities that remains unclaimed
at the end of two years after such principal, premium or interest has become due and payable will be repaid to us, and the holder of the debt security thereafter may look only to us for payment thereof. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We can issue securities in registered form or in the form of one or more global securities. We describe global securities in greater detail below. We refer to
those persons who have securities registered in their own names on the books that we or any applicable trustee, depositary or warrant agent maintain for this purpose as the “holders” of those securities. These persons are the legal holders
of the securities. We refer to those persons who, indirectly through others, own beneficial interests in securities that are not registered in their own names, as “indirect holders” of those securities. As we discuss below, indirect
holders are not legal holders, and investors in securities issued in book-entry form or in street name will be indirect holders. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Book-Entry Holders
</B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We may issue securities in book-entry form only, as we will specify in the applicable prospectus supplement. This means securities may be represented
by one or more global securities registered in the name of a financial institution that holds them as depositary on behalf of other financial institutions that participate in the depositary’s book-entry system. These participating institutions,
which are referred to as participants, in turn, hold beneficial interests in the securities on behalf of themselves or their customers. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Only the person
in whose name a security is registered is recognized as the holder of that security. Securities issued in global form will be registered in the name of the depositary or its participants. Consequently, for securities issued in global form, we will
recognize only the depositary as the holder of the securities, and we will make all payments on the securities to the depositary. The depositary passes along the payments it receives to its participants, which in turn pass the payments along to
their customers who are the beneficial owners. The depositary and its participants do so under agreements they have made with one another or with their customers; they are not obligated to do so under the terms of the securities. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As a result, investors in a book-entry security will not own securities directly. Instead, they will own beneficial interests in a global security, through a
bank, broker or other financial institution that participates in the depositary’s book-entry system or holds an interest through a participant. As long as the securities are issued in global form, investors will be indirect holders, and not
holders, of the securities. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Street Name Holders </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We
may terminate a global security or issue securities in <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-global</FONT> form. In these cases, investors may choose to hold their securities in their own names or in “street name.” Securities held by an
investor in street name would be registered in the name of a bank, broker or other financial institution that the investor chooses, and the investor would hold only a beneficial interest in those securities through an account he or she maintains at
that institution. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">For securities held in street name, we or any applicable trustee or depositary will recognize only the intermediary banks, brokers and
other financial institutions in whose names the securities are registered as the holders of those securities, and we or any applicable trustee or depositary will make all payments on those securities to them. These institutions pass along the
payments they receive to their customers who are the beneficial owners, but only because they agree to do so in their customer agreements or because they are legally required to do so. Investors who hold securities in street name will be indirect
holders, not holders, of those securities. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Legal Holders </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our obligations, as well as the obligations of any applicable trustee and of any third parties employed by us or a trustee, run only to the legal holders of
the securities. We do not have obligations to investors who hold beneficial interests in global securities, in street name or by any other indirect means. This will be the case whether an investor chooses to be an indirect holder of a security or

depositary, or its nominee, will be the sole registered owner and holder of all securities represented by a global security, and investors will be permitted to own only beneficial interests in a global security. Beneficial interests must be held by
means of an account with a broker, bank or other financial institution that in turn has an account with the depositary or with another institution that does. Thus, an investor whose security is represented by a global security will not be a holder
of the security, but only an indirect holder of a beneficial interest in the global security. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">If the prospectus supplement for a particular security

securities offered by the prospectus supplement, other than securities covered by any over-allotment option. Any public offering price and any discounts or concessions allowed or reallowed or paid to dealers may change from time to time. We may use
underwriters with whom we have a material relationship. We will describe in the prospectus supplement, naming the underwriter, the nature of any such relationship. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We may sell securities directly or through agents we designate from time to time. We will name any agent involved in the offering and sale of securities and

for solicitation of these contracts in the prospectus supplement. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We may provide agents and underwriters with indemnification against civil liabilities,

Exchange Act. Over-allotment involves sales in excess of the offering size, which create a short position. Stabilizing transactions permit bids to purchase the underlying security so long as the stabilizing bids do not exceed a specified maximum
price. Syndicate-covering or other short-covering transactions involve purchases of the securities, either through exercise of the over-allotment option or in the open market after the distribution is completed, to cover short positions. Penalty
bids permit the underwriters to reclaim a selling concession from a dealer when the securities originally sold by the dealer are purchased in a stabilizing or covering transaction to cover short positions. Those activities may cause the price of the
securities to be higher than it would otherwise be. If commenced, the underwriters may discontinue any of the activities at any time. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Any underwriters or

prior to the pricing of the offering, before the commencement of offers or sales of the common stock. Passive market makers must comply with applicable volume and price limitations and must be identified as passive market makers. In general, a
passive market maker must display its bid at a price not in excess of the highest independent bid for such security; if all independent bids are lowered below the passive market maker’s bid, however, the passive market maker’s bid must
then be lowered when certain purchase limits are exceeded. Passive market making may stabilize the market price of the securities at a level above that which might otherwise prevail in the open market and, if commenced, may be discontinued at any
time. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In compliance with guidelines of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, or FINRA, the maximum consideration or discount to be received by any
