There is no arrangement for funds to be received in any escrow, trust or similar arrangement. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:ARIAL">Cowen will be entitled to compensation at a commission rate equal to
3.0% of the gross sales price per share sold under the sales agreement. See “Plan of Distribution” beginning on page <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">S-9</FONT> for additional information regarding the compensation to be paid to Cowen. In
connection with the sale of the common stock on our behalf, Cowen will be deemed to be an “underwriter” within the meaning of the Securities Act and the compensation of Cowen will be deemed to be underwriting commissions or discounts. We
have also agreed to provide indemnification and contribution to Cowen with respect to certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. </P> <P STYLE="font-size:12pt;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt">&nbsp;</P><center>

<P STYLE="margin-top:4pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:3%; font-size:10pt; font-family:ARIAL">We are a commercial stage life sciences company focused on advancing the promise of precision medicine. Our product and service solutions are based on
our proprietary next generation digital HTG EdgeSeq technology that enables the detection and measurement of biomarkers using a small amount of biological sample, in liquid or solid forms. Our menu of HTG EdgeSeq assays are automated on our HTG
EdgeSeq platform, which applies genetic sequencing tools that generate expression data in a timely manner utilizing a simplified workflow for customers. We seek to leverage key business drivers in molecular profiling for biomarker analysis and
diagnostics, including the acceleration of precision medicine, the migration of molecular testing to next-generation sequencing (NGS)-based applications, the movement to smaller and less invasive biopsies, the need for greater diagnostic
sensitivity, the need to conform to challenging healthcare economics and the need for automation and an easily deployable workflow. For example, these capabilities enable customers to extend the use of limited biological samples for retrospective
analysis, gaining further understanding of the molecular drivers of disease with the goal of developing biomarker-driven targeted therapies. We also believe our technology can be used in clinical applications that will simplify, consolidate and
reduce the cost of <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">NGS-based</FONT> diagnostic workflows and in commercialized companion diagnostic tests. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:ARIAL"><B>Corporate

described below and discussed under the caption “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">10-K</FONT> for the fiscal year ended December&nbsp;31, 2018, as updated by our quarterly, annual and other
reports and documents that we have filed or subsequently file that are incorporated by reference into this prospectus supplement, before deciding whether to purchase any common stock in this offering. Each of the risk factors could adversely affect
our business, operating results and financial condition, as well as adversely affect the value of an investment in our common stock, and the occurrence of any of these risks might cause you to lose all or part of your investment. Additional risks
not presently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may also significantly impair our business operations. </I></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:ARIAL"><B>Additional Risks Related to

management will have broad discretion as to the application of the net proceeds from this offering and could use them for purposes other than those contemplated at the time of this offering. Our stockholders may not agree with the manner in which
our management chooses to allocate and spend the net proceeds. Moreover, our management may use the net proceeds for corporate purposes that may not increase the market price of our common stock. </P>

Assuming that an aggregate of 17,316,017 shares of our common stock are sold at a price of $2.31 per share pursuant to this prospectus supplement, which was the last reported sale price of our common stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market on
March&nbsp;11, 2019, for aggregate gross proceeds of $40.0&nbsp;million, after deducting commissions and estimated aggregate offering expenses payable by us, you would experience immediate dilution of $1.02 per share, representing the difference
between our as adjusted net tangible book value per share as of December&nbsp;31, 2018 after giving effect to this offering and the assumed offering price. See “Dilution” in this prospectus supplement for a more detailed illustration of
the dilution you would incur if you participate in this offering. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:ARIAL"><B><I>You may experience future dilution as a result of future equity offerings. </I></B></P>

exchangeable for our common stock at prices that may not be the same as the price per share in this offering. We may sell shares or other securities in any other offering at a price per share that is less than the price per share paid by any
investors in this offering, and investors purchasing shares or other securities in the future could have rights superior to existing stockholders. The price per share at which we sell additional shares of our common stock, or securities convertible
or exchangeable into common stock, in future transactions may be higher or lower than the price per share paid by any investors in this offering. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:ARIAL"><B><I>We do not

Cowen will use its commercially reasonable efforts to sell on our behalf all of the shares of common stock requested to be sold by us. We may instruct Cowen not to sell common stock if the sales cannot be effected at or above the price designated by
us in any such instruction. Cowen or we may suspend the offering of our common stock being made through Cowen under the sales agreement upon proper notice to the other party. Cowen and we each have the right, by giving written notice as specified in

with this offering, and for certain other expenses, including Cowen’s FINRA counsel fees in an amount up to $12,500. We estimate that the total expenses of the offering payable by us, excluding commissions payable to Cowen under the sales

heading “Risk Factors” contained in the applicable prospectus supplement and any related free writing prospectus, and under similar headings in our Annual Report on <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">Form&nbsp;10-K</FONT> for the fiscal year
ended December&nbsp;31, 2017, as updated by our quarterly, annual and other reports and documents that are incorporated by reference into this prospectus, before deciding whether to purchase any common stock being registered pursuant to the
registration statement of which this prospectus is a part. Each of the risk factors could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition, as well as adversely affect the value of an investment in our common stock, and the
occurrence of any of these risks might cause you to lose all or part of your investment. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may also significantly impair our business operations. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">This prospectus, each prospectus supplement and the information incorporated by reference in this prospectus and each prospectus supplement
contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section&nbsp;27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, and Section&nbsp;21E of the Exchange Act that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Although our
forward-looking statements reflect the good faith judgment of our management, these statements can only be based on facts and factors currently known by us. Consequently, these forward-looking statements are inherently subject to risks and
uncertainties, and actual results and outcomes may differ materially from results and outcomes discussed in the forward-looking statements. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of forward-looking words such as “believe,” “expect,”
“hope,” “may,” “will,” “plan,” “intend,” “estimate,” “could,” “should,” “would,” “continue,” “seek,” “pro forma,” or
“anticipate,” or other similar words (including their use in the negative), or by discussions of future matters such as our ability to successfully commercialize our products and services, the development of new products, technology
enhancements, possible collaborations, possible changes in legislation and other statements that are not historical. In addition, statements that “we believe” and similar statements reflect our beliefs and opinions on the relevant subject.
These statements are based upon information available to us as of the date the statement is made, and while we believe such information forms a reasonable basis for such statements, such information may be limited or incomplete, and our statements
should not be read to indicate that we have conducted an exhaustive inquiry into, or review of, all potentially available relevant information. These statements are inherently uncertain and investors are cautioned not to unduly rely upon these
statements. Forward-looking statements include but are not limited to statements under the captions “Business,” “Risk Factors” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations” and in other sections incorporated by reference from our Annual Report on <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">Form&nbsp;10-K</FONT> and Quarterly Reports on <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">Form&nbsp;10-Q,</FONT> as applicable, as well
as our other filings with the SEC. You should be aware that the occurrence of any of the events discussed under the heading “Risk Factors” in any applicable prospectus supplement and any documents incorporated by reference herein or
therein could substantially harm our business, operating results and financial condition and that if any of these events occurs, it could adversely affect the value of an investment in our common stock. </P>

appear in this prospectus or in any prospectus supplement or any documents incorporated by reference herein or therein. We urge you not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they are made.
Except as required by law, we assume no obligation to update our forward-looking statements, even if new information becomes available in the future. </P>

transactions and penalty bids in accordance with Regulation M under the Exchange Act. Overallotment involves sales in excess of the offering size, which create a short position. This short sales position may involve either “covered” short
sales or “naked” short sales. Covered short sales are short sales made in an amount not greater than the underwriters’ over-allotment option to purchase additional shares in the offering. The underwriters may close out any covered
short position either by exercising their over-allotment option or by purchasing shares of our common stock in the open market. To determine how they will close the covered short position, the underwriters will consider, among other things, the
price of shares available for purchase in the open market, as compared to the price at which they may purchase shares through the over-allotment option. Naked short sales are short sales in excess of the over-allotment option. The underwriters must
close out any naked short position by purchasing shares in the open market. A naked short position is more likely to be created if the underwriters are concerned that, in the open market after pricing, there may be downward pressure on the price of
the shares that could adversely affect investors who purchase shares in the offering. Stabilizing transactions permit bids to purchase the underlying security for the purpose of fixing the price of the security so long as the stabilizing bids do not
exceed a specified maximum. Penalty bids permit the underwriters to reclaim a selling concession from a dealer when the securities originally sold by the dealer are purchased in a covering transaction to cover short positions. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Any underwriters who are qualified market makers on The Nasdaq Capital Market, or any other stock exchange or which our common stock may be
listed at the time of sale, may engage in passive market making transactions in our common stock on The Nasdaq Capital Market or such other stock exchange in accordance with Rule 103 of Regulation M, during the business day prior to the pricing of
the offering, before the commencement of offers or sales of the shares of our common stock. Passive market makers must comply with applicable volume and price limitations and must be identified as passive market makers. In general, a passive market
maker must display its bid at a price not in excess of the highest independent bid for our common stock; if all independent bids are lowered below the passive market maker’s bid, however, the passive market maker’s bid must then be lowered
when certain purchase limits are exceeded. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Similar to other purchase transactions, an underwriter’s purchase to cover the syndicate
short sales or to stabilize the market price of our common stock may have the effect of raising or maintaining the market price of our common stock or preventing or mitigating a decline in the market price of our common stock. As a result, the price
of our common stock may be higher than the price that might otherwise exist in the open market. The imposition of a penalty bid might also have an effect on the price of the common stock if it discourages resales of the shares. </P>
