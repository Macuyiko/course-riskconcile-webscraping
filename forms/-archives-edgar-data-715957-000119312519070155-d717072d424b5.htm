we are offering at this time. Generally, when we refer to the prospectus, we are referring to both parts of this document combined. To the extent the description of the Senior Notes in the prospectus supplement differs from the description of Senior
Debt Securities in the accompanying base prospectus, you should only rely on the information in the prospectus supplement. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">This document

2018, which are incorporated by reference in this prospectus supplement. In consultation with your own financial and legal advisers, you should carefully consider, among other matters, the discussions of risks that we have incorporated by reference
before deciding whether an investment in the Senior Notes is suitable for you. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">See WHERE YOU CAN FIND MORE INFORMATION on page S-4. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Set forth below is a description of the specific terms of the Senior Notes. The term “Senior Notes” includes both the Series A
Senior Notes and the New Series B Senior Notes. This description supplements, and should be read together with, the description of the general terms and provisions of the Senior Debt Securities set forth in the accompanying base prospectus under the
captions DESCRIPTION OF DEBT SECURITIES and ADDITIONAL TERMS OF THE SENIOR DEBT SECURITIES and, to the extent it is inconsistent with the accompanying base prospectus, replaces the description in the accompanying base prospectus. The Series A Senior
Notes will be issued under our Senior Indenture dated as of June 1, 2015 (the Senior Indenture), as supplemented and amended from time to time by supplemental indentures, including by the Sixteenth Supplemental Indenture, dated as of March 1, 2019
(the Sixteenth Supplemental Indenture). The New Series B Senior Notes will be issued under the Senior Indenture, as supplemented and amended from time to time by supplemental indentures, including the Fifteenth Supplemental Indenture, dated as of
June 1, 2018 (the Fifteenth Supplemental Indenture). The following description is not complete in every detail and is subject to, and is qualified in its entirety by reference to, the description of the Senior Debt Securities in the accompanying
base prospectus, the Senior Indenture, the Sixteenth Supplemental Indenture and the Fifteenth Supplemental Indenture. Capitalized terms used in this DESCRIPTION OF THE SENIOR NOTES that are not defined in this prospectus supplement have the meanings
given to them in the accompanying base prospectus, the Senior Indenture or Sixteenth Supplemental Indenture and Fifteenth Supplemental Indenture, as applicable. In this DESCRIPTION OF THE SENIOR NOTES section, references to “Dominion
Energy,” “we,” “us” and “our” mean Dominion Energy, Inc., excluding any of its subsidiaries unless otherwise expressly stated or the context otherwise requires. </P>

be an unsecured senior obligation of Dominion Energy. The Series A Senior Notes will be initially limited in aggregate principal amount to $&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. We may, without the consent of the
existing holders of the Series A Senior Notes, issue additional notes having the same ranking and the same interest rate, maturity and other terms as the Series A Senior Notes. Any additional notes having such similar terms, together with any of the
Series&nbsp;A Senior Notes, will constitute a single series of notes under the Senior Indenture. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The New Series&nbsp;B Senior Notes will
be issued as part of the Series B Senior Notes, which are Senior Debt Securities under the Senior Indenture. The New Series&nbsp;B Senior Notes will have the same terms (other than issue date, initial interest payment date and public offering price)
as the Initial Series B Senior Notes and will rank <I>pari passu</I> with, and vote together with, the Initial Series B Senior Notes on any matter submitted to the holders of such series. The Initial Series B Senior Notes were issued on June 5, 2018
in an aggregate principal amount of $300,000,000. Upon the issuance of the New Series&nbsp;B Senior Notes, the outstanding aggregate principal amount of Series B Senior Notes will be
$&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. We may, without the consent of the existing holders of the Series&nbsp;B Senior Notes, issue additional notes having the same ranking and the same interest rate, maturity and
other terms as the Series B Senior Notes. Any additional notes having such similar terms, together with the Series B Senior Notes, will constitute a single series of notes under the Senior Indenture. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The entire principal amount of the Series A Senior Notes will mature and become due and payable, together with any accrued and unpaid interest
thereon, on March 15, 2049. The entire principal amount of the New Series B Senior Notes will mature and become due and payable, together with any accrued and unpaid interest thereon, on June 1, 2028. The Senior Notes are not subject to any sinking
fund provision. The Senior Notes are available for purchase in denominations of $2,000 and any greater integral multiple of $1,000. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Interest </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Series A Senior Notes will bear interest at the rate of &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;% per year from the date of
original issuance. The New Series B Senior Notes will bear interest at the rate of 4.25% per year from the date of original issuance. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Interest is payable on the Series A Senior Notes semi-annually in arrears on March 15 and
September 15 of each year (each, an Interest Payment Date). The initial Interest Payment Date for the Series A Senior Notes is September 15, 2019. Interest is payable on the New Series B Senior Notes semi-annually in arrears on June 1 and December 1
of each year (each, an Interest Payment Date). The initial Interest Payment Date for the New Series B Senior Notes is June 1, 2019. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The
amount of interest payable will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months. If any date on which interest is payable on the Senior Notes is not a business day, then payment of the interest payable on that date will be made on
the next succeeding day which is a business day (and without any interest or other payment in respect of any delay), with the same force and effect as if made on such date. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">So long as the Senior Notes remain in book-entry only form, the record date for each Interest Payment Date will be the close of business on
the business day before the applicable Interest Payment Date. If the Senior Notes are not in book-entry only form, the record date for each Interest Payment Date will be the close of business on the fifteenth calendar day before the applicable
Interest Payment Date (whether or not a business day); however, interest payable at maturity or upon redemption or repurchase will be paid to the person to whom principal is payable. </P>

unsecured and unsubordinated obligations, will rank equally with all of our other senior unsecured debt, will be senior in right of payment to all of our subordinated indebtedness, and will be effectively subordinated to our secured debt, if any.
</P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Because we are a holding company and conduct all of our operations through our subsidiaries, which include Virginia Power, Dominion
Energy Gas, Dominion Energy Questar, SCANA and other subsidiaries, our ability to meet our obligations under the Senior Notes is dependent on the earnings and cash flows of those subsidiaries and the ability of those subsidiaries to pay dividends or
to advance or repay funds to us. Certain of our regulated subsidiaries may, from time to time, be subject to certain restrictions imposed by regulators on their ability to pay dividends or to advance or repay funds to us. For a discussion of any
current or potential restrictions, please refer to the quarterly and annual reports that we file with the SEC. Holders of Senior Notes generally will have a junior position to claims of creditors of our subsidiaries, including trade creditors,
debtholders, secured creditors, taxing authorities, guarantee holders and any preferred stockholders. As of December 31, 2018, our subsidiaries, excluding SCANA, had approximately $21.3&nbsp;billion principal amount of outstanding long-term debt
(including securities due within one year and credit facility borrowings). As of December 31, 2018, SCANA had approximately $6.8 billion principal amount of outstanding long-term debt (including securities due within one year and credit facility
borrowings). </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Senior Indenture contains no restrictions on the amount of additional indebtedness that we or our subsidiaries may incur
or the amount of preferred stock that our subsidiaries may issue. We and our subsidiaries expect to incur additional indebtedness from time to time. </P>

“banking organization” within the meaning of the New York Banking Law, a member of the Federal Reserve System, a “clearing corporation” within the meaning of the New York Uniform Commercial Code, and a “clearing agency”
registered pursuant to the provisions of Section&nbsp;17A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. DTC holds and provides asset servicing for over 3.5&nbsp;million issues of U.S. and <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-U.S.</FONT> equity issues,
corporate and municipal debt issues, and money market instruments (from over 100 countries) that DTC’s participants (Direct Participants) deposit with DTC. DTC also facilitates the post-trade settlement among Direct Participants of sales and
other securities transactions in deposited securities, through electronic computerized book-entry transfers and pledges between Direct Participants’ accounts. This eliminates the need for physical movement of securities certificates. Direct
Participants include both U.S. and <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-U.S.</FONT> securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, clearing corporations, and certain other organizations. DTC is a wholly-owned subsidiary of The Depository
Trust&nbsp;&amp; Clearing Corporation (DTCC). DTCC is the holding company for DTC, National Securities Clearing Corporation and Fixed Income Clearing Corporation, all of which are registered clearing agencies. DTCC is owned by the users of its
regulated subsidiaries. Access to the DTC system is also available to others such as both U.S. and <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-U.S.</FONT> securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, and clearing corporations that clear through
or maintain a custodial relationship with a Direct Participant, either directly or indirectly (Indirect Participants). DTC has a Standard&nbsp;&amp; Poor’s rating of AA+. The DTC Rules applicable to its Participants are on file with the

the DTC system must be made by or through Direct Participants, which will receive a credit for the Senior Notes on DTC’s records. The ownership interest of each actual purchaser of each Senior Note (Beneficial Owner) is in turn to be recorded
on the Direct and Indirect Participants’ records. Beneficial Owners will not receive written confirmation from DTC of their purchase. Beneficial Owners are, however, expected to receive written confirmations providing details of the

disposition of the Senior Notes. This discussion is for general information only and does not address all of the potential U.S. federal income tax considerations that may be relevant to a holder with respect to the purchase, ownership and
disposition of the Senior Notes. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the discussion does not address the effect of any special rules applicable to certain types of holders, including, without limitation, dealers in securities or
currencies, insurance companies, financial institutions, thrifts, mutual funds, real estate investment trusts, regulated investment companies, tax-exempt entities, personal holding companies, controlled foreign corporations, passive foreign
investment companies, U.S. persons whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar, U.S. expatriates (or former long-term residents of the United States), persons who hold Senior Notes as part of a straddle, hedge, conversion transaction, or other
risk reduction or integrated investment transaction, investors in securities that elect to use a mark-to-market method of accounting for their securities holdings, individual retirement accounts or qualified pension plans, investors in pass-through
entities, including partnerships and Subchapter S corporations that invest in the Senior Notes, or persons subject to special tax accounting rules as a result of any item of gross income with respect to the Senior Notes being taken into account in
an applicable financial statement. In addition, this discussion is limited to holders of the Senior Notes who purchase the Senior Notes in the initial offering at their “issue price” and hold the Senior Notes as “capital assets”
within the meaning of section 1221 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code). For this purpose only, the “issue price” of the Senior Notes is the first price at which a substantial amount of the Senior Notes are sold for
cash to persons other than bond houses, brokers or similar persons or organizations acting in the capacity of underwriters, placement agents or wholesalers. For purposes of this discussion, “holder” means either a U.S. holder (as defined
below) or a non-U.S. holder (as defined below) or both, as the context may require. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The discussion is based upon provisions of the Code,
U.S. Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder (the Treasury Regulations), rulings, pronouncements, judicial decisions and administrative interpretations of the Internal Revenue Service (the IRS), all as in effect as of the date of this prospectus

circumstances (see “DESCRIPTION OF THE SENIOR NOTES—Optional Redemption”), we may be obligated to pay amounts in excess of the stated interest or principal on the Senior Notes and/or pay amounts in redemption of the Senior Notes prior

treated as “contingent payment debt instruments” within the meaning of the applicable Treasury Regulations. However, additional income will be recognized to a holder of Senior Notes if any such additional payment is made. Our position that
the contingencies described above are remote is binding on a holder, unless the holder discloses in the proper manner to the IRS that it is taking a different position. If the IRS successfully challenged our position, then the Senior Notes could be
treated as contingent payment debt instruments, in which case holders could be required to accrue interest income at a rate higher than the stated interest rate on the Senior Notes and to treat as ordinary income, rather than capital gain, any gain
recognized on a sale, exchange, redemption or other taxable disposition of a Senior Note. The remainder of this discussion assumes that the Senior Notes will not be treated as contingent payment debt instruments. </P>

term of the New Series B Senior Note and may offset stated interest income otherwise required to be included in respect of the New Series B Senior Note during any taxable year by the amortized amount of such excess for the taxable year. The election
to amortize the premium on a constant yield method, once made, will also apply to all other debt obligations with bond premium that a holder of a New Series B Senior Note holds at the beginning of or acquires in or after the first taxable year to
which the election applies and may not be revoked without the consent of the IRS. If a U.S. Holder of a New Series B Senior Note does not elect to amortize the premium, the premium will decrease the gain or increase the loss such U.S. Holder would
otherwise recognize on the sale, exchange, redemption or other taxable disposition of a New Series B Senior Note. Prospective purchasers of the New Series B Senior Notes are urged to consult their tax advisors with respect to the rules relating to

notes) paid to (i) a “foreign financial institution” (as specifically defined in the Code), whether such foreign financial institution is the beneficial owner or an intermediary, unless such foreign financial institution agrees to verify,
report and disclose its “United States account holders” (as specifically defined in the Code) and meets certain other specified requirements or (ii) a “non-financial foreign entity” (as specifically defined in the Code), whether
such non-financial foreign entity is the beneficial owner or an intermediary, unless such non-financial foreign entity provides a certification that the beneficial owner of the payment does not have any substantial U.S. owners or provides the name,
address and taxpayer identification number of each substantial U.S. owner and certain other specified requirements are met. In certain cases, the relevant foreign financial institution or non-financial foreign entity may qualify for an exemption
from, or be deemed to be in compliance with, these rules. Foreign entities located in jurisdictions that have entered into an intergovernmental agreement with the United States governing FATCA may be subject to different rules. If an interest
payment is both subject to withholding under FATCA and subject to the withholding tax discussed above under “—Non-U.S. Holders—Payments of Interest on the Senior Notes,” the withholding under FATCA may be credited against, and
