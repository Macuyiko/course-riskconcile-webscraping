Our product is produced through an electrolysis process that uses specialized electronic cells coated with a variety of rare earth minerals to produce our 8.8 pH drinking water without the use of any manmade chemicals. Our product also incorporates 84 trace minerals from Himalayan pink rock salt. Our product is designed to have a clean smooth taste using only purified water and the Himalayan pink rock salt. We believe consumers drink our water because of the taste profile and the preconceived health benefits (although we do not market our products as having any potential health benefits), as well as because of our brand and trademark, which we believe is one of the most easily identifiable in the category. Measured by sales volume in 2018, we believe we are now one of the largest alkaline water companies in the United States. </p><p style="text-align:justify;">Our product is presently available in all 50 states and the District of Columbia, although over 50% of our current sales are concentrated in the Southwest and Texas. We distribute our product through several channels. We sell through large national distributors, including UNFI, KeHE, C&S, and Core-Mark. We also sell our product to retail clients, including convenience stores, natural food products stores, large ethnic markets and national retailers. Examples of our retail clients include Walmart, Food Lion, Albertson's, Safeway, Kroger, Schnucks, Smart & Final, Jewel-Osco, Sprouts, Bashas', Stater Bros. Markets, Unified Grocers, Bristol Farms, Vallarta, Superior Foods, Ingles, HEB and Brookshire's. The majority of our sales to retail clients are through brokers and distributors, however, sales to our larger retail clients are often direct to the client's own warehouse distribution network.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Our operating subsidiary operates primarily as a marketing, distribution, and manufacturing company. It has entered into co-packing agreements with eight different bottling companies located in Virginia, Georgia, California, Texas, Nevada and Arizona to act as co-packers for our product. Our current capacity at all plants exceeds approximately $8.3 million per month wholesale. </p><p style="text-align:justify;">Archpoint Group, a business and marketing consulting firm and sales broker, has been engaged to assist our company in all aspects of our marketing, trade promotion and brand development. Their expertise in all aspects of consumer goods brand development, marketing and promotional programs is expected to help us meet the growing consumer demand for both our flagship Alkaline88<sup>&reg;</sup> product and our upcoming A88 Infused product line. Water Source One, a producer of private labeled bottled water, has been engaged to assist in the manufacturing, procurement and logistical aspects of our business. Their specialized water production capabilities companies is expected to allow us to support the growing demand for our products. We believe this arrangement will enable us to further scale production and distribution as the Alkaline88<sup>&reg;</sup> brand continues to gain market share. E.A. Berg, a sales and merchandising broker, has been engaged to implement a unique "Van Program" (where sales representatives sell products directly from vans to the retailers) throughout Texas and California which is intended to bring both our flagship Alkaline88<sup>&reg;</sup> products and, once launched, A88 Infused's products to over 13,000 independently owned convenience stores in those markets. We expect to be able to expand the program to an additional nine US markets over the next few years. Our component materials are readily available through multiple vendors. Our principal suppliers are Vav Plastics Inc., Amcor Inc. and Packaging Corporation of America.<i> </i>The electrolysis process through which our product is produced is proprietary to us and, while the process is not patented, we seek to protect the process through the maintenance of trade secrets and know-how.<i>  </i></p></div><hr style="page-break-after: always;" width="100%" size="5" color="black"><a name="page_5"></a><div><div><p style="text-align:center;">S-5</p></div><p><i><b>A88 Infused Beverage Division, Inc.</b></i></p><p style="text-align:justify;">In August 2018, we formed A88 Infused Beverage Division, Inc., or A88 Infused, a Nevada corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of our company. A88 Infused's <font style="background-color:#ffffff;">focus is brand extension and product innovations in the wellness water category. We formed A88 Infused to meet what we believe is increasing consumer demand for enhanced and functional (value-added) beverages. We expect A88 Infused to capitalize on this and potential consumer demand with the development and launch of new products focused on growing trends in the beverage space.</font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font style="background-color:#ffffff;">To prepare for the launch of products by A88 Infused, we have expanded our packaging capabilities.  We announced in January, 2019 that Nevada-based Western Group Packing has agreed to produce A88 Infused's flavored Alkaline88<sup>&reg;</sup> water products and its planned hemp extract-infused water product at its 150,000+ square feet facility located in North Las Vegas, NV.  We have received verbal confirmation from many of our current retail clients of their interest in purchasing our flavored Alkaline88<sup>&reg;</sup> waters. The production of A88 Infused's planned hemp extract product is contingent on U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA, and state laws, regulations, and guidance. While the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 removed hemp from Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act, the law did not change FDA's authorities with respect to food or drugs. As of March 8, 2019, the FDA has not made a determination that the use of hemp extract in food is safe. FDA has evaluated Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) notices for three hemp seed-derived food ingredients and determined that the agency has no questions that those ingredients are GRAS under their intended conditions of use.  </font></p><p style="text-align:justify;"><font style="background-color:#ffffff;">In early February 2019, at the Convenience EPPS trade show in Chicago, Illinois, we sampled and offered up for sale "Alkaline88<sup>&reg;</sup> Flavored," which is available in five different, all natural, sugar-free flavors.  We believe "Alkaline88<sup>&reg;</sup> Flavored" is the first flavored bottled alkaline water to be sold in the United States. </font></p><p style="text-align:justify;"><font style="background-color:#ffffff;">A88 Infused is also developing and preparing for the initial launch of its planned hemp extract product, which will be marketed under the trademark <i>Soothe&trade;</i>. In the event FDA issues appropriate regulations or guidance or determines that it has no questions that hemp extract is GRAS under intended conditions of use that would permit A88 Infused to market hemp extract in water without food additive approval, we expect to produce and sell <i>Soothe&trade; </i>as both a sparkling water in cans and as still water in bottles. We may also decide to market <i>Soothe&trade; </i>if a supplier meets and complies with FDA's GRAS regulations with respect to a self-certification regarding the safety and GRAS status of the use of hemp extract. We expect to produce <i>Soothe&trade;</i> as a low calorie or no calorie, hemp extract-infused water in five flavors.<i> </i>We may change the composition of our planned hemp-extract-infused product as necessary to comply with federal, state or local laws, regulations or guidance.</font></p><p style="text-align:justify;"><font style="background-color:#ffffff;">We intend to comply in full with all federal, state, and local laws, rules and regulations as we develop our hemp extract alkaline water and other product lines. We will not pursue the production or sale of hemp extract-infused products until legally permitted.</font></p><p><i><b>Plan of Operations</b></i></p><p style="text-align:justify;">In order for us to implement our business plan over the next 12 months, we have identified the following milestones that we expect to achieve: </p><ul type="disc" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="margin-top:12pt;margin-left:27.6pt;text-align:justify;padding-left:8.4pt;"><u>Expansion of Broker Network </u>- We expect to continue to develop our working relationship with our national broker network. We continually meet, train, and go on sales call with our national broker network in order to take advantage of the momentum currently being created by their efforts. We anticipate a considerable amount of travel and ongoing expenses at an estimated cost during that time of $300,000. </li><li style="margin-top:12pt;margin-left:27.6pt;text-align:justify;padding-left:8.4pt;"><u>Increase Manufacturing Capacity </u>- (i) Flagship Alkaline88 product: we expect to add one to two new co-packer facilities, strategically located to reduce freight costs and meet current volumes and future growth objectives; and (ii) A88 Infused: we expect to add three to five new co-packer facilities strategically located to meet anticipated volumes by product type and future growth objectives. </li></ul></div><hr style="page-break-after: always;" width="100%" size="5" color="black"><a name="page_6"></a><div><div><p style="text-align:center;">S-6</p></div><ul type="disc" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="margin-top:12pt;margin-left:27.6pt;text-align:justify;padding-left:8.4pt;"><u>Expand Retail Distribution </u>- We continue to expand our retail presence. The cost of this retail expansion over the next 12 months is expected to be up to $1,000,000.</li><li style="margin-top:12pt;margin-left:27.6pt;text-align:justify;padding-left:8.4pt;"><u>Addition of Support Staff </u>- In order to support expansion efforts and to continue the training and support of our broker network, we anticipate that we will need to hire approximately four more people on the corporate level for the specific purpose of supporting the broker, distributor and retailers and their logistical and accounting requirements. We continue to seek and interview candidates to fill our growing need for additional staffing. The additional cost of these new hires is expected to be approximately $450,000 in salary and benefits over the next 12 months.</li><li style="margin-top:12pt;margin-left:27.6pt;text-align:justify;padding-left:8.4pt;"><u>Capital Considerations </u>- Our business plan can be adjusted based on the available capital to the business. We anticipate that approximately $1,000,000 is necessary in the near term in order to build out a national presence for our product and to allow for the purchase of the necessary equipment and facilities over the next 12 months. To fund our expansion in the longer term, we anticipate that we need at least $4,000,000 during the next 12 months. </li><li style="margin-top:12pt;margin-left:27.6pt;text-align:justify;padding-left:8.4pt;"><u>International Expansion </u>- We expect to begin selling internationally, including Canada, over the next 12 months and have budgeted $160,000 towards our initial efforts. </li></ul><p style="text-align:justify;">The milestones set forth above, including the estimates with respect to expenses and capital needs, and the assumptions upon which they are based, reflect our current judgment and belief regarding the direction of our business.  Actual events, expenditures and results will almost always vary, sometimes materially, from any estimates, predictions, projections or assumptions suggested herein.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">We believe that cash flow from operations will not meet our present and near-term cash needs, including those relating to our engagements of Archpoint Group, Water Source One and E.A. Berg, and our cash needs for the above milestones over the next 12 months and thus we will require additional cash resources, including from the sale of equity or debt securities, to meet our planned capital expenditures and working capital requirements for the next 12 months. If our own financial resources and future cash-flows from operations are insufficient to satisfy our capital requirements, we may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain additional credit facilities. The sale of additional equity securities will result in dilution to our stockholders. The incurrence of indebtedness will result in increased debt service obligations and could require us to agree to operating and financial covenants that could restrict our operations or modify our plans to grow the business. Financing may not be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all. Any failure by us to raise additional funds on terms favorable to us, or at all, will limit our ability to expand our business operations and could harm our overall business prospects.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">We have not yet established an ongoing source of revenues sufficient to cover our operating costs and to allow us to continue as a going concern. As of December 31, 2018, we had an accumulated deficit of $35,858,604. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on our company obtaining adequate capital to fund operating losses until we become profitable. If we are unable to obtain adequate capital, we could be forced to significantly curtail or cease operations. In its report on our financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2018, our independent registered public accounting firm included an explanatory paragraph regarding substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">The principal offices of our company are located at 14646 N.

You should carefully consider the following risks and uncertainties in addition to other information contained in or incorporated by reference in this prospectus supplement and the accompanying prospectus in evaluating our company and our business before making an investment decision about our company. Our business, operating results and financial condition could be seriously harmed as a result of the occurrence of any of the following risks. You could lose all or part of your investment due to any of these risks.</p><p><b>Risks Related to This Offering</b></p><p style="text-align:justify;"><i><b>Management will have broad discretion as to the use of the proceeds from this offering, and we may not use the proceeds effectively.</b></i></p><p style="text-align:justify;">Our management will have broad discretion as to the use of the net proceeds from any offering by us and could use them for purposes other than those contemplated at the time of this offering. Accordingly, you will be relying on the judgment of our management with regard to the use of these net proceeds, and you will not have the opportunity, as part of your investment decision, to assess whether the proceeds are being used appropriately. It is possible that the proceeds will be invested in a way that does not yield a favorable, or any, return for our company.</p><p style="text-align:justify;"><i><b>You will experience immediate and substantial dilution as a result of this offering and may experience additional dilution in the future.</b></i></p>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">You will incur immediate and substantial dilution as a result of this offering. After giving effect to the sale by us of 4,000,000  shares of our common stock at a public offering price of $2.50  per share, excluding the exercise of the underwriters' option to purchase additional shares, and after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us, investors in this offering can expect an immediate dilution of $2.18  per share, or 87.2%, at the public offering price. To the extent any warrants or options that we have issued, are exercised, or shares of our preferred stock that we have issued, is converted, you will sustain future dilution. We may also acquire other assets or businesses by issuing equity, which may result in additional dilution to our stockholders. </p>
  <p><b>Risks Related to Our Business</b></p><p style="text-align:justify;"><i><b>Because we have a limited operating history, we may have difficulty realizing consistent and meaningful revenues and achieving profitability.</b></i></p><p style="text-align:justify;">We were incorporated on June 6, 2011, and we only began producing and distributing alkaline bottled water in 2013. Since we have a limited operating history, our ability to successfully develop our products and to realize consistent and meaningful revenues and to achieve profitability has not been established and cannot be assured. For us to realize consistent, meaningful revenues and to achieve profitability, our products must receive broad market acceptance by consumers. Without this market acceptance, we will not be able to generate sufficient revenue to continue our business operation. If our products are not widely accepted by the market, our business may fail. </p><p style="text-align:justify;">Our ability to achieve and maintain profitability and positive cash flow is dependent upon our ability to generate revenues, manage development costs and expenses, and compete successfully with our direct and indirect competitors. We anticipate operating losses in upcoming future periods. This will occur because there are expenses associated with the development, production, marketing, and sales of our products. </p><p style="text-align:justify;"><i><b>Our independent registered public accounting firm has expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. </b></i></p><p style="text-align:justify;">Our financial statements are prepared using generally accepted accounting principles in the United States applicable to a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. We have not yet established an ongoing source of revenues sufficient to cover our operating costs and to allow us to continue as a going concern. As of December 31, 2018, we had an accumulated deficit of $35,858,604. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on our company obtaining adequate capital to fund operating losses until we become profitable. If we are unable to obtain adequate capital, we could be forced to significantly curtail or cease operations. </p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">In its report on our financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2018, our independent registered public accounting firm included an explanatory paragraph regarding substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. </p><p style="text-align:justify;"><i><b>We will need additional funds to continue producing, marketing, and distributing our products. </b></i></p><p style="text-align:justify;">We will have to spend additional funds to continue producing, marketing and distributing our products. If we cannot raise sufficient capital, we may have to cease operations and you could lose your investment. We will need additional funds to continue to produce our products for distribution to our target market. We will have to continue to spend substantial funds on distribution, marketing and sales efforts before we will know if we have commercially viable and marketable/sellable products. </p><p style="text-align:justify;"><i><b>There is no guarantee that sufficient sale levels will be achieved. </b></i></p><p style="text-align:justify;">There is no guarantee that the expenditure of money on distribution and marketing efforts will translate into sufficient sales to cover our expenses and result in profits. Consequently, there is a risk that you may lose all of your investment. </p><p style="text-align:justify;"><i><b>Our development, marketing, and sales activities are limited by our size. </b></i></p><p style="text-align:justify;">Because we are small and do not have much capital, we must limit our product development, marketing, and sales activities. As such, we may not be able to complete our production and business development program in a manner that is as thorough as we would like. We may not ever generate sufficient revenues to cover our operating and expansion costs and you may, therefore, lose your entire investment. </p><p style="text-align:justify;"><i><b>Changes in the non-alcoholic beverage business environment and retail landscape could adversely impact our financial results. </b></i></p><p style="text-align:justify;">The non-alcoholic beverage business environment is rapidly evolving as a result of, among other things, changes in consumer preferences, including changes based on health and nutrition considerations and obesity concerns; shifting consumer tastes and needs; changes in consumer lifestyles; and competitive product and pricing pressures. In addition, the non-alcoholic beverage retail landscape is very dynamic and constantly evolving, not only in emerging and developing markets, where modern trade is growing at a faster pace than traditional trade outlets, but also in developed markets, where discounters and value stores, as well as the volume of transactions through e-commerce, are growing at a rapid pace. If we are unable to successfully adapt to the rapidly changing environment and retail landscape, our share of sales, volume growth and overall financial results could be negatively affected. </p><p style="text-align:justify;"><i><b>Intense competition and increasing competition in the commercial beverage market could hurt our business. </b></i></p><p style="text-align:justify;">The commercial retail beverage industry, and in particular its non-alcoholic beverage segment, is highly competitive. Market participants are of various sizes, with various market shares and geographical reach, some of whom have access to substantially more sources of capital. </p><p style="text-align:justify;">We compete generally with all liquid refreshments, including bottled water and numerous specialty beverages, such as:<font style="color:#1f497d;"> </font>CORE&reg; Hydration, SOBE&reg;, Snapple&reg;, AriZona&reg; Iced Tea, vitaminwater&reg;, Gatorade Perform&reg;, and POWERADE&reg;. </p><p style="text-align:justify;">We compete indirectly with major international beverage companies including but not limited to: The Coca-Cola Company&reg;, PepsiCo, Inc., The Nestl&eacute; Group, Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc, Danone S.A., The Kraft Heinz Company, and Unilever PLC. These companies have established market presence in the United States and globally, and offer a variety of beverages that are competitors to our products. We face potential direct competition from such companies, because they have the financial resources, and access to manufacturing and distribution channels to rapidly enter the alkaline water market. We compete directly with other alkaline water producers and brands focused on the emerging alkaline beverage market including<font style="color:#1f497d;">: </font>Eternal Naturally Alkaline&reg; Spring Water, Essentia&reg;, CORE&reg; Hydration, Icelandic Glacial&trade;, Real Water&reg;, AQUAhydrate&reg;, Mount Valley Spring Water&trade;, QURE Water&reg;, Penta&reg; Water, and Alka Power&trade;. These companies could bolster their position in the alkaline water market through additional expenditure and promotion. </p>

  <p style="text-align:center;">S-10</p></div>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As a result of both direct and indirect competition, our ability to successfully distribute, market and sell our products, and to gain sufficient market share in the United States and around the world to realize profits may be limited, greatly diminished, or totally diminished, which may lead to partial or total loss of your investments in our company.</p><p style="text-align:justify;"><i><b>Alternative non-commercial beverages or processes could hurt our business. </b></i></p><p style="text-align:justify;">The availability of non-commercial beverages, such as tap water, and machines capable of producing alkaline water at the consumer's home or at store-fronts could hurt our business, market share, and profitability. </p><p style="text-align:justify;"><i><b>Expansion of the alkaline beverage market or sufficiency of consumer demand in that market for operations to be profitable are not guaranteed. </b></i></p><p style="text-align:justify;">The alkaline water market is an emerging market and there is no guarantee that this market will expand or that consumer demand will be sufficiently high enough to allow our company to successfully market, distribute and sell our products, or to successfully compete with current or future competition, all of which may result in total loss of your investment. </p><p style="text-align:justify;"><i><b>A failure to introduce new products or product extensions into new marketplaces successfully could prevent us from achieving long-term profitability.</b></i></p><p style="text-align:justify;">We compete in an industry characterized by rapid changes in consumer preferences, so our ability to continue developing new products to satisfy our consumers' changing preferences will determine our long-term success. A failure to introduce new products or product extensions into new marketplaces successfully could prevent us from achieving long-term profitability. In addition, customer preferences are also affected by factors other than taste, such as the publicity. If we do not adjust to respond to these and other changes in customer preferences, our sales may be adversely affected. In addition, a failure to obtain any required regulatory approvals for our proposed products could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. </p><p style="text-align:justify;"><i><b>Our growth and profitability depends on the performance of third-party brokers and distributors and on our ongoing relationships with them. </b></i></p><p style="text-align:justify;">Our distribution network and its success depend on the performance of third parties. Any non-performance or deficient performance by such parties may undermine our operations, profitability, and result in total loss of your investment. To distribute our products, we use a broker-distributor-retailer network whereby brokers represent our products to distributors and retailers who will in turn sell our products to consumers. The success of this network will depend on the performance of the brokers, distributors and retailers within this network. There is a risk that a broker, distributor, or retailer may refuse to or cease to market or carry our products. There is a risk that the mentioned entities may not adequately perform their functions within the network by, without limitation, failing to distribute to sufficient retailers or positioning our products in localities that may not be receptive to our products. Furthermore, such third-parties' financial position or market share may deteriorate, which could adversely affect our distribution, marketing and sale activities. We also need to maintain good commercial relationships with third-party brokers, distributors and retailers so that they will promote and carry our products. Any adverse consequences resulting from the performance of third-parties or our relationship with them could undermine our operations, profitability and may result in total loss of your investment. </p></div><hr style="page-break-after: always;" width="100%" size="5" color="black"><a name="page_11"></a><div><div><p style="text-align:center;">S-11</p></div><p style="text-align:justify;"><i><b>The loss of one or more of our major customers or a decline in demand from one or more of these customers could harm our business. </b></i></p><p style="text-align:justify;">We have 2 major customers that together account for 46% (30% and 16%, respectively) of accounts receivable at December 31, 2018, and 2 customers that together account for 43% (24% and 19%, respectively) of the total revenues earned for the three months ended December 31, 2018. There can be no assurance that such customers will continue to order our products at the same level or at all. A reduction or delay in orders from such customers, including reductions or delays due to market, economic or competitive conditions, could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. </p><p style="text-align:justify;"><i><b>Our dependence on a limited number of vendors leaves us vulnerable to having an inadequate supply of required products, price increases, late deliveries, and poor product quality. </b></i></p><p style="text-align:justify;">We have three vendors that accounted for 59% (36%, 12% and 11%, respectively) of purchases for the three months ended December 31, 2018. Like other companies in our industry, we occasionally experience shortages and are unable to purchase our desired volume of products. Increasingly, our vendors are combining and merging together, leaving us with fewer alternative sources. If we are unable to maintain an adequate supply of products, our revenue and gross profit could suffer considerably. Finally, we cannot provide any assurance that our products will be available in quantities sufficient to meet customer demand. Any limits to product access could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations. </p><p style="text-align:justify;"><i><b>Our business is sensitive to public perception. If any product proves to be harmful to consumers or if scientific studies provide unfavorable findings regarding their safety or effectiveness, then our image in the marketplace would be negatively impacted.</b></i></p><p style="text-align:justify;">Our results of operations may be significantly affected by the public's perception of our company and similar companies. Our business could be adversely affected if any of our products or similar products distributed by other companies proves to be harmful to consumers or if scientific studies provide unfavorable findings regarding the safety or effectiveness of our products or any similar products. If our products suffer from negative consumer perception, it is likely to adversely affect our business and results of operations. </p><p style="text-align:justify;"><i><b>Consumers may have preconceptions about the health benefits of alkaline water; such health benefits are not guaranteed or proven. </b></i></p><p style="text-align:justify;">Health benefits of alkaline water are not guaranteed and have not been proven. Although we do not market our products as having any potential health benefits, there is a consumer perception that drinking alkaline water has beneficial health effects. Consequently, negative changes in consumers' perception of the benefits of alkaline water or negative publicity surrounding alkaline water may result in loss of market share or potential market share and hence, loss of your investment. We are also prohibited from touting unconfirmed health benefits in our advertising and promotional activities for the products, both directly and indirectly through claims made by third-party endorsers when those endorsers have a material connection to our company. </p><p style="text-align:justify;"><i><b>Water scarcity and poor quality could negatively impact our production costs and capacity. </b></i></p><p style="text-align:justify;">Water is the main ingredient in our products. It is also a limited resource, facing unprecedented challenges from overexploitation, increasing pollution, poor management, and climate change. As demand for water continues to increase, as water becomes scarcer, and as the quality of available water deteriorates, we may incur increasing production costs or face capacity constraints that could adversely affect our profitability or net operating revenues in the long run. </p><p style="text-align:justify;"><i><b>Increase in the cost, disruption of supply or shortage of ingredients, other raw materials or packaging materials could harm our business. </b></i></p><p style="text-align:justify;">We and our bottlers will use water, 84 trace minerals from Himalayan salts and packaging materials for bottles such as plastic and paper products. The prices for these ingredients, other raw materials and packaging materials fluctuate depending on market conditions. Substantial increases in the prices of our or our bottlers' ingredients, other raw materials and packaging materials, to the extent they cannot be recouped through increases in the prices of finished beverage products, could increase our operating costs and could reduce our profitability. Increases in the prices of our finished products resulting from a higher cost of ingredients, other raw materials and packaging materials could affect the affordability of our products and reduce sales. </p>
</div><hr style="page-break-after: always;" width="100%" size="5" color="black"><a name="page_12"></a><div><div>
  <p style="text-align:center;">S-12</p></div>
<p style="text-align:justify;">An increase in the cost, a sustained interruption in the supply, or a shortage of some of these ingredients, other raw materials, or packaging materials and containers that may be caused by a deterioration of our or our bottlers' relationships with suppliers; by supplier quality and reliability issues; or by events such as natural disasters, power outages, labor strikes, political uncertainties or governmental instability, or the like, could negatively impact our net revenues and profits. </p><p style="text-align:justify;"><i><b>Unfavorable general economic conditions in the United States could negatively impact our financial performance. </b></i></p><p style="text-align:justify;">Unfavorable general economic conditions, such as a recession or economic slowdown, in the United States could negatively affect the affordability of, and consumer demand for, our products in the United States. Under difficult economic conditions, consumers may seek to reduce discretionary spending by forgoing purchases of our products or by shifting away from our beverages to lower-priced products offered by other companies, including non-alkaline water. Consumers may also cease purchasing bottled water and consume tap water. Lower consumer demand for our products in the United States could reduce our profitability.</p><p style="text-align:justify;"><i><b>Adverse weather conditions could reduce the demand for our products. </b></i></p><p style="text-align:justify;">The sales of our products are influenced to some extent by weather conditions in the markets in which we operate. Unusually cold or rainy weather during the summer months may have a temporary effect on the demand for our products and contribute to lower sales, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations for such periods. </p><p style="text-align:justify;"><i><b>We rely on third parties to produce and bottle our products, which creates additional risk. </b></i></p><p style="text-align:justify;">We do not own or operate bottling or co-packing facilities used for the production of the various water products in our portfolio. We rely on those third parties to ensure the quality, safety and integrity of our products. If the third parties that we engage to produce and bottle our products fail to meet our demands or are found by government agencies to be out of compliance with applicable regulatory requirements, our supplies of those products and our future profit margins could be adversely affected.</p><p style="text-align:justify;"><i><b>Product contamination or tampering or issues or concerns with respect to product quality, safety and integrity could adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition or results of operations.</b></i></p><p style="text-align:justify;">Product contamination or tampering, the failure to maintain high standards for product quality, safety and integrity, including with respect to raw materials and ingredients obtained from suppliers, or allegations (whether or not valid) of product quality issues, mislabeling, misbranding, spoilage, allergens, adulteration or contamination with respect to products in our portfolio may reduce demand for such products, and cause production and delivery disruptions or increase costs, each of which could adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition or results of operations. If any of the products in our portfolio are mislabeled or become unfit for consumption or cause injury, illness or death, or if appropriate resources are not devoted to product quality and safety (particularly as we expand our portfolio into new categories) or to comply with changing food safety requirements, we could decide to, or be required to, recall products or withdraw from the marketplace and/or we may be subject to liability or government action, which could result in payment of damages or fines, cause certain products in our portfolio to be unavailable for a period of time, result in destruction of product inventory, or result in adverse publicity (whether or not valid), which could reduce consumer demand and brand equity. Moreover, even if allegations of product contamination or tampering or suggestions that our products were not fit for consumption are meritless, the negative publicity surrounding assertions against us or products in our portfolio or processes could adversely affect our reputation or brands. Our business could also be adversely affected if consumers lose confidence in product quality, safety and integrity generally, even if such loss of confidence is unrelated to products in our portfolio. Any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, if we do not have adequate insurance, if we do not have enforceable indemnification from suppliers, bottlers, distributors or other third parties or if indemnification is not available, the liability relating to such product claims or disruption as a result of recall efforts could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><i><b>Our products are considered premium beverages and are being sold at premium prices compared to our competitors' products; we cannot provide any assurances as to consumers' continued market acceptance of our current and future products. </b></i></p><p style="text-align:justify;">We will compete directly with other alkaline water producers and brands focused on the emerging alkaline beverage market including Eternal, Essentia, Core, Icelandic, Real Water, Aqua Hydrate, Mountain Valley, Qure, Penta, and Alka Power. Products offered by our direct competitors are sold in various volumes and prices with prices ranging from approximately $0.99 for a half-liter bottle to $4.99 for a one-gallon bottle, and volumes ranging from half-liter bottles to one-gallon bottles. We currently offer our product in a one-gallon bottle for a suggested resale price or an SRP of $4.99, three-liter bottle for an SRP of $3.99, 1.5 liter at an SRP of $2.49, 1 liter at an SRP of $1.99, 700 milliliter single serving at an SRP of $1.19, and a 500 milliliter at an SRP of $0.99. Our competitors may introduce larger sizes and offer them at an SRP that is lower than our products. We can provide no assurances that consumers will continue to purchase our products or that they will not prefer to purchase a competitive product. </p><p style="text-align:justify;"><i><b>We are subject to periodic claims and litigation that could result in unexpected expenses and could ultimately be resolved against us. </b></i></p><p style="text-align:justify;">From time to time, we are involved in litigation and other proceedings, including matters related to product liability claims, stockholder class action and derivative claims, commercial disputes and intellectual property, as well as trade, regulatory, employment, and other claims related to our business. Any of these proceedings could result in significant settlement amounts, damages, fines or other penalties, divert financial and management resources, and result in significant legal fees. An unfavorable outcome of any particular proceeding could exceed the limits of our insurance policies or the carriers may decline to fund such final settlements and/or judgments and could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. In addition, any proceeding could negatively impact our reputation among our guests and our brand/image.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">For example, our company was named as a defendant in a lawsuit filed on April 6, 2017, by Douglas Horn. Mr. Horn sought damages arising out of the alleged breach of a written employment agreement between our company and Mr. Horn. Mr. Horn alleged that our company has failed to pay wages and to transfer stock allegedly owed to him under the terms of his employment agreement. Our company denied the allegations of the claims, and moved to dismiss pursuant to the terms of the employment agreement which require that all disputes be resolved by arbitration. In response, Mr. Horn filed a notice of dismissal of all claims in that court, without prejudice. On September 21, 2017, Mr. Horn filed a Demand for Arbitration with the American Arbitration Association, asserting the same claims. Our company has responded, denying any liability to Mr. Horn and the matter is currently in the discovery phase. The arbitration has been set for a three day hearing on March 19 to 21, 2019. Our company intends to defend the claim vigorously.</p><p style="text-align:justify;"><i><b>We regularly evaluate potential expansion into international markets, and any expansion into such international operations could subject us to risks and expenses that could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. </b></i></p><p style="text-align:justify;">To date, we have not undertaken substantial commercial activities outside of the United States. We have evaluated, and continue to evaluate, potential expansion into certain other international markets. If and when we seek to expand internationally in the future, our sales and operations would be subject to a variety of risks, including fluctuations in currency exchange rates, tariffs, import restrictions and other trade barriers, unexpected changes in legal and regulatory requirements, longer accounts receivable payment cycles, potentially adverse tax consequences, and difficulty in complying with foreign laws and regulations, as well as U.S. laws and regulations that govern foreign activities. Economic uncertainty in some of the geographic regions in which we might operate could result in the disruption of commerce and negatively impact our operations in those areas. Also, if we choose to pursue international expansion efforts, it may be necessary or desirable to contract with third parties, and we may not be able to enter into such agreements on commercially acceptable terms or at all. Further, such arrangements may not perform to our expectations, and we may be exposed to various risks as a result of the activities of our partners.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">We are highly dependent on two executive officers, Richard A. Wright and David A. Guarino, who have extensive knowledge of our business and the industry in which we operate. We do not have "key person" life insurance policies for either of these officers. The loss of Richard A. Wright and/or David A. Guarino could result in delays in product development, loss of any future customers and sales and diversion of management resources, which could adversely affect our operating results. </p><p style="text-align:justify;"><i><b>If we are unable to protect our information systems against service interruption, misappropriation of data or breaches of security, our operations could be disrupted, we may suffer financial losses and our reputation may be damaged.</b></i></p><p style="text-align:justify;">We rely on networks and information systems and other technology (<b>"information systems"</b>), including the Internet and third-party hosted services, to support a variety of business processes and activities, including procurement and supply chain, manufacturing, distribution, invoicing and collection of payments, employee processes and consumer marketing. We use information systems to process financial information and results of operations for internal reporting purposes and to comply with regulatory financial reporting and legal and tax requirements. In addition, we depend on information systems for digital marketing activities and electronic communications between our company and our bottlers and other customers, suppliers and consumers. Because information systems are critical to many of our operating activities, our business may be impacted by system shutdowns, service disruptions or security breaches. These incidents may be caused by failures during routine operations such as system upgrades or by user errors, as well as network or hardware failures, malicious or disruptive software, unintentional or malicious actions of employees or contractors, cyberattacks by common hackers, criminal groups or nation-state organizations or social-activist (hacktivist) organizations, geopolitical events, natural disasters, failures or impairments of telecommunications networks, or other catastrophic events. In addition, such incidents could result in unauthorized or accidental disclosure of material confidential information or regulated individual personal data. If our information systems suffer severe damage, disruption or shutdown and our business continuity plans do not effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner, we could experience delays in reporting our financial results, and we may lose revenue and profits as a result of our inability to timely manufacture, distribute, invoice and collect payments for concentrate or finished products. Unauthorized or accidental access to, or destruction, loss, alteration, disclosure, falsification or unavailability of, information could result in violations of data privacy laws and regulations, damage to the reputation and credibility of our company and, therefore, could have a negative impact on net operating revenues. In addition, we may suffer financial and reputational damage because of lost or misappropriated confidential information belonging to us, our current or former employees, our bottling partners, other customers or suppliers, or consumers or other data subjects, and may become exposed to legal action and increased regulatory oversight. We could also be required to spend significant financial and other resources to remedy the damage caused by a security breach or to repair or replace networks and information systems.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">In addition, third-party providers of data hosting or cloud services, as well as our bottling partners, distributors, retailers or suppliers, may experience cybersecurity incidents that may involve data we share with them. Although we have taken steps to prevent cybersecurity incidents, there can be no assurance that such steps will be adequate. In order to address risks to our information systems, we continue to make investments in personnel, technologies and training of our personnel. </p><p><b>Risks Related to Regulations Applicable to our Industry</b></p><p style="text-align:justify;"><i><b>Changes in laws and regulations relating to beverage containers and packaging could increase our costs and reduce our net operating revenues or profitability. </b></i></p><p style="text-align:justify;">We and our bottlers offer our products in non-refillable, recyclable containers in the United States. Regulations have been enacted in various jurisdictions in the United States requiring that deposits or certain ecotaxes or fees be charged for the sale, marketing and use of certain non-refillable beverage containers. Other proposals relating to beverage container deposits, recycling, ecotax and/or product stewardship have been introduced in various jurisdictions in the United States and overseas, and we anticipate that similar legislation or regulations may be proposed in the future at local, state and federal levels in the United States. Consumers' increased concerns and changing attitudes about solid waste streams and environmental responsibility and the related publicity could result in the adoption of such legislation or regulations. Current regulations or the adoption of future regulations in the geographical regions in which we currently operate or intend to operate could adversely affect our costs or require changes in our distribution model, which could reduce our net operating revenues or profitability.</p>

Federal laws may preempt some or all of these attempts by state or localities to impose additional labeling or warning requirements.  If these types of requirements become applicable to our products under current or future environmental or health laws or regulations, they may inhibit sales of our products. Moreover, if we fail to meet compliance deadlines for any such new requirements, our products may be deemed misbranded or mislabeled and could be subject to enforcement action, or we could be exposed to private lawsuits alleging misleading labels or product promotion.</p><p style="text-align:justify;"><i><b>Changes in, or failure to comply with, the laws and regulations applicable to our products or our business operations could increase our costs or reduce our net operating revenues.</b></i></p><p style="text-align:justify;">The advertising, distribution, labeling, production, safety, sale, and transportation in the United States of our currently marketed products are subject to: the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act; the Federal Trade Commission Act; the Lanham Act; state food and drug laws; state consumer protection laws; competition laws; federal, state, and local workplace health and safety laws, such as the Occupational Safety and Health Act; various federal, state and local environmental protection laws; and various other federal, state, and local statutes and regulations. Changes to such laws and regulations could increase our costs or reduce our net operating revenues. </p><p style="text-align:justify;">In addition, failure to comply with environmental, health or safety requirements and other applicable laws or regulations could result in the assessment of damages, the imposition of penalties, suspension of production, changes to equipment or processes, or a cessation of operations at our or our bottlers' facilities, as well as damage to our image and reputation, all of which could harm our profitability. </p><p style="text-align:justify;"><i><b>If we fail to comply with personal data protection laws, we could be subject to adverse publicity, government enforcement actions and/or private litigation, which could negatively affect our business and operating results.</b></i></p><p style="text-align:justify;">In the ordinary course of our business, we receive, process, transmit and store information relating to identifiable individuals (<b>"personal data"</b>), primarily employees and former employees. As a result, we are subject to various U.S. federal and state and foreign laws and regulations relating to personal data. These laws have been subject to frequent changes, and new legislation in this area may be enacted in other jurisdictions at any time. There is no assurance that our security controls over personal data, the training of employees and vendors on data privacy and data security, and the policies, procedures and practices we implemented or may implement in the future will prevent the improper disclosure of personal data. Improper disclosure of personal data in violation of applicable personal data protection laws could harm our reputation, cause loss of consumer confidence, subject us to government enforcement actions (including fines), or result in private litigation against us, which could result in loss of revenue, increased costs, liability for monetary damages, fines and/or criminal prosecution, all of which could negatively affect our business and operating results.</p></div><hr style="page-break-after: always;" width="100%" size="5" color="black"><a name="page_16"></a><div><div><p style="text-align:center;">S-16</p></div><p style="text-align:justify;"><i><b>If we produce, market and/or sell beverages infused with hemp, as defined under the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018, we will be subject to a myriad of different laws and regulations governing the use of hemp in food and beverages and if we are unable to comply with such laws in a cost-effective manner, our business could be adversely affected.</b></i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font style="background-color:#ffffff;">The production of a beverage infused with hemp, </font>as "hemp" is defined in the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 (also known as the 2018 Farm Bill, Public Law 115-334), <font style="background-color:#ffffff;">is contingent on U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA, and state laws, regulations, and guidance. While the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 removed hemp from Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act, the law did not change FDA's authorities with respect to food or drugs. As of March 8, 2019, the FDA has not made a determination that the use of hemp in food is safe. FDA has evaluated Generally Recognized as Safe or GRAS notices for three hemp seed-derived food ingredients and determined that the agency has no questions that those ingredients are GRAS under their intended conditions of use.  We intend to comply in full with all federal, state, and local laws, rules and regulations as we develop our hemp alkaline water and other product lines. We will not pursue the production or sale of hemp-infused products until legally permitted.</font></p><p style="text-align:justify;">Laws and regulations governing the use of hemp in food and beverages in the United States are broad in scope; subject to evolving interpretations; and subject to enforcement by a myriad of regulatory agencies and law enforcement entities. Under the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018, a state or Indian tribe that desires to have primary regulatory authority over the production of hemp in the state or territory of the Indian tribe must submit a plan to monitor and regulate hemp production to the Secretary of the United States Department of Agriculture or USDA.  The Secretary must then approve the state or tribal plan after determining if the plan complies with the requirements set forth in the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018.  The Secretary may also audit the state or Indian tribe's compliance with the federally-approved plan.  If the Secretary does not approve the state or Indian tribe's plan, then the production of hemp in that state or territory of that Indian tribe will be subject to a plan established by USDA.  USDA has not yet established such a plan.  We anticipate that many states will seek to have primary regulatory authority over the production of hemp.  States that seek such authority may create new laws and regulations that permit the use of hemp in food and beverages.  </p><p style="text-align:justify;">Federal and state laws and regulations on hemp may address production, monitoring, manufacturing, distribution, and laboratory testing to ensure that that the hemp has a delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol concentration of not more than 0.3 percent on a dry weight basis.  Federal laws and regulations may also address the transportation or shipment of hemp or hemp products, as the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 prohibits states and Indian tribes from prohibiting the transportation or shipment of hemp or hemp products produced in accordance with that law through the state or territory of the Indian tribe, as applicable.  Because we rely on a nationwide broker-distributor-retailer network whereby brokers represent our products to distributors and retailers in turn sell our product to consumers in the fifty states and the District of Columbia, we may be subject to many different state-based regulatory regimens for hemp, all of which could require us to incur substantial costs associated with compliance requirements. In addition, violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could disrupt our business and result in a material adverse effect on our operations, as well as adverse publicity and potential harm to our reputation. We and our suppliers and vendors must take significant enterprise risk management steps to ensure that there is no commingling of hemp and marihuana, as "marihuana" is defined in the federal Controlled Substances Act.  Marihuana remains subject to the Controlled Substances Act and related regulations.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Furthermore, if we decide to produce, market and sell beverages infused with hemp outside of the United States, we will be subject to applicable laws and regulations in those non-U.S. jurisdictions, which would require us to expend significant costs associated with compliance.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">In addition, it is possible that additional regulations may be enacted in the future in the United States and globally that will be directly applicable to our proposed product offerings infused with hemp. We cannot predict the nature of any future laws, regulations, interpretations, or applications, nor can we determine what effect additional governmental regulations or administrative policies and procedures, when and if promulgated, could have on our business.</p></div><hr style="page-break-after: always;" width="100%" size="5" color="black"><a name="page_17"></a><div><div><p style="text-align:center;">S-17</p></div><p style="text-align:justify;"><i><b>FDA's current position is that the sale of food and beverages that contain hemp-derived cannabidiol or CBD is prohibited under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act; therefore, if we decide to produce, market and/or sell beverages infused with hemp-derived cannabidiol, we may be subject to federal enforcement actions which could adversely affect our business and harm our reputation and brand. </b></i></p><p style="text-align:justify;">FDA has jurisdiction over drugs and foods that contain CBD, including CBD derived from hemp.  Under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act or the FDCA, it is a prohibited act to introduce or deliver for introduction into interstate commerce any food (which the FDCA defines to include beverages) that is adulterated. The FDCA therefore prohibits the introduction or delivery for introduction of a food that contains CBD, because the FDCA deems a food to be adulterated if it bears or contains any food additive that is unsafe and CBD is presently an unsafe food additive under the FDCA and FDA regulations.  The FDCA also states that it is a prohibited act to introduce or deliver for introduction into interstate commerce any food to which an FDA-approved drug has been added, unless certain exceptions are met.  FDA has approved a drug in which CBD is an active ingredient, and the agency has stated that based on available evidence, none of the exceptions apply to CBD.  One of the exceptions addresses whether the drug was marketed in food before the FDA approved the drug and before the institution of any substantial clinical investigations involving the drug.  FDA has stated that interested parties may present the agency with evidence that has bearing on the issue of whether CBD was marketed in food before the FDA approved the CBD drug in 2018 or before the institution of substantial clinical investigations involving the CBD drug.  FDA's current position is that this provision of the FDCA also prohibits the introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of a food to which CBD has been added.  </p><p style="text-align:justify;">Congress may decide to amend the FDCA to permit the use of hemp-derived CBD in food.  FDA may also decide to issue regulations or guidance that address the use of hemp-derived CBD in food or use its enforcement discretion with respect to hemp-derived CBD products.  On February 27, 2019, the FDA Commissioner stated that the agency is interested in hearing from Congress and stakeholders with respect to a regulatory framework for CBD products.  Any legislative or regulatory action could take years to implement or finalize and may not include provisions that would enable our company to produce, market and/or sell hemp beverages that contain hemp-derived CBD.  We risk becoming subject to adverse publicity and costly federal enforcement actions should we decide to product, market and/or sell beverages infused with hemp-derived CBD in the United States.  We may be required to expend significant resources in defending our company from such actions which could adversely affect our business and results of operations and divert the attention of management. We may also incur the risk of sustaining considerable damage to our reputation and brand should we become party to federal enforcement actions resulting from the production, marketing or sale of hemp-derived CBD infused beverages. </p><p style="text-align:justify;">Accordingly, if Congress amended federal laws or FDA issued regulations or guidance permitting the use of hemp-derived CBD in food or announcing the agency's decision to use its enforcement discretion with respect to hemp-derived CBD products, we and our suppliers and vendors would be required to implement significant enterprise risk management measures to ensure that there is no commingling of CBD derived from marihuana, as "marihuana" is defined in the federal Controlled Substances Act, with any future commercial supply of hemp-derived CBD that is used to produce our products.</p><p style="text-align:justify;"><i><b>The FDA could force the removal of our products from the U.S. market.</b></i></p><p style="text-align:justify;">The FDA has broad authority over the regulation of our products. The FDA could, among other things, force us to remove our products from the U.S. market, levy fines or change their regulations on advertising. Any adverse action by the FDA could have a material adverse impact on our business.</p><p style="text-align:justify;"><i><b>Government reviews, inquiries, investigations, and actions could harm our business or reputation. </b></i></p><p style="text-align:justify;">As our product portfolio evolves, the regulatory environment with regard to our business is also evolving. Government officials often exercise broad discretion in deciding how to interpret and apply applicable laws or regulations. We may in the future receive formal and informal inquiries from various governmental regulatory authorities, as well as self-regulatory organizations or consumer protection watchdog groups, about our business and compliance with local laws, regulations, or standards. Any determination that our products, operations or activities, or the activities of our employees, contractors or agents, are not in compliance with existing laws, regulations or standards, could adversely affect our business in a number of ways. Even if such an inquiry does not result in the imposition of fines, interruptions to our business, loss of suppliers or other third-party relationships, terminations of necessary licenses and permits, or similar direct results, the existence of the inquiry alone could potentially create negative publicity that could harm our business and/or reputation. </p>

<p><b>Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property</b></p><p style="text-align:justify;"><i><b>It is difficult and costly to protect our intellectual property.</b></i></p><p style="text-align:justify;">Our commercial success will depend in part on obtaining and maintaining trademark protection and trade secret/know-how protection of our products and brands, as well as successfully defending that intellectual property against third-party challenges. We will only be able to protect our intellectual property related to our trademarks and brands to the extent that we have rights under valid and enforceable trademarks, know-how or trade secrets that cover our products and brands. Changes in either the trademark laws or in interpretations of trademark and laws in the U.S. and other countries may diminish the value of our intellectual property. Accordingly, we cannot predict the breadth of claims that may be allowed or enforced in our issued trademarks. The degree of future protection for our proprietary rights is uncertain because legal means afford only limited protection and may not adequately protect our rights or permit us to gain or keep our competitive advantage.</p><p style="text-align:justify;"><i><b>We may face intellectual property infringement claims that could be time-consuming and costly to defend, and could result in our loss of significant rights and the assessment of treble damages.</b></i></p><p style="text-align:justify;">From time to time we may face intellectual property claims from third parties. Some of these claims may lead to litigation. The outcome of any such litigation can never be guaranteed, and an adverse outcome could affect us negatively. For example, were a third party to succeed on an infringement claim against us, we may be required to pay substantial damages (including up to treble damages if such infringement were found to be willful). In addition, we could face an injunction, barring us from conducting the allegedly infringing activity. The outcome of the litigation could require us to enter into a license agreement which may not be under acceptable, commercially reasonable, or practical terms or we may be precluded from obtaining a license at all. It is also possible that an adverse finding of infringement against us may require us to dedicate substantial resources and time in developing non-infringing alternatives, which may or may not be possible. </p><p style="text-align:justify;">Finally, we may initiate claims to assert or defend our own intellectual property against third parties. Any intellectual property litigation, irrespective of whether we are the plaintiff or the defendant, and regardless of the outcome, is expensive and time-consuming, and could divert our management's attention from our business and negatively affect our operating results or financial condition.</p><p style="text-align:justify;"><i><b>We may be subject to claims by third parties asserting that our employees or our company has misappropriated their intellectual property, or claiming ownership of what we regard as our own intellectual property.</b></i></p><p style="text-align:justify;">Although we try to ensure that our company, our employees, and independent contractors (suppliers/vendors/distributors) do not use the proprietary information or know-how of others in their work for us, we may be subject to claims that our company, our employees, or independent contractors (suppliers/vendors/distributors) have used or disclosed intellectual property in violation of others' rights. These claims may cover a range of matters, such as challenges to our trademarks, as well as claims that our employees or independent contractors are using trade secrets or other proprietary information of any such employee's former employer or independent contractors. As a result, we may be forced to bring claims against third parties, or defend claims they may bring against us, to determine the ownership of what we regard as our intellectual property. If we fail in prosecuting or defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel. Even if we are successful in prosecuting or defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management.</p></div><hr style="page-break-after: always;" width="100%" size="5" color="black"><a name="page_19"></a><div><div><p style="text-align:center;">S-19</p></div><p><b>Risks Related to Our Stock </b></p><p style="text-align:justify;"><i><b>Because we can issue additional shares of common stock, our stockholders may experience dilution in the future. </b></i></p>

Our board of directors has the authority to cause us to issue additional shares of common stock and preferred stock, and to determine the rights, preferences and privileges of shares of our preferred stock, without consent of our stockholders. Consequently, the stockholders may experience more dilution in their ownership of our stock in the future. </p><p style="text-align:justify;"><i><b>Trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market or TSX Venture Exchange may be volatile, which could depress the market price of our common stock and make it difficult for our stockholders to resell their shares.</b></i></p><p style="text-align:justify;">Our common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market and the TSX Venture Exchange. Trading of our common stock may experience wide fluctuations in trading prices, due to many factors that may have little to do with our operations or business prospects. This volatility could depress the market price of our common stock for reasons unrelated to operating performance. </p><p style="text-align:justify;"><i><b>A prolonged and substantial decline in the price of our common stock could affect our ability to raise further working capital, thereby adversely impacting our ability to continue operations.</b></i></p><p style="text-align:justify;">A prolonged and substantial decline in the price of our common stock could result in a reduction in the liquidity of our common stock and a reduction in our ability to raise capital. Because we plan to acquire a significant portion of the funds we need in order to conduct our planned operations through the sale of equity securities, a decline in the price of our common stock could be detrimental to our liquidity and our operations because the decline may cause investors not to choose to invest in our stock. If we are unable to raise the funds we require for all our planned operations and to meet our existing and future financial obligations, we may be forced to reallocate funds from other planned uses and may suffer a significant negative effect on our business plan and operations, including our ability to develop new products and continue our current operations. As a result, our business may suffer, and we may go out of business. </p><p style="text-align:justify;"><i><b>Because we do not intend to pay any cash dividends on our shares of common stock in the near future, our stockholders will not be able to receive a return on their shares unless they sell them. </b></i></p><p style="text-align:justify;">We intend to retain any future earnings to finance the development and expansion of our business.

We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering for general corporate purposes, which may include reducing any outstanding indebtedness, increasing our working capital or capital expenditures.

As of December 31, 2018, our net tangible book value was $3,307,488, or $0.10 per share of our common stock. Our net tangible book value per share is equal to total assets less intangible assets and total liabilities, divided by the number of shares of our outstanding common stock. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Net tangible book value dilution per share represents the difference between the amount per share of common stock paid by the new investors who purchase shares of our common stock in this offering and the pro forma net tangible book value per share in our common stock immediately after completion of this offering. After giving effect to our sale of 4,000,000 shares of our common stock at a public offering price of $2.50 per share, excluding the exercise of the underwriters&rsquo; option to purchase additional shares, and after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us, our pro forma net tangible book value as of December 31, 2018 would have been $12,017,488, or $0.32 per share. This represents an immediate increase of net tangible book value of $0.22 per share to our existing stockholders and an immediate dilution in net tangible book value of $2.18 per share to purchasers of shares of our common stock in this offering.

In addition, we may choose to raise additional capital depending on market conditions, our capital requirements and strategic considerations, even if we believe we have sufficient funds for our current or future operating plans. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the issuance of these securities could result in further dilution to our stockholders.</p>

<p style="margin-left:10pt;text-indent:-10pt;text-align:justify;"><b>Option to Purchase Additional Shares </b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We have granted an option to the underwriters to purchase up to an aggregate of 600,000 additional shares of our common stock at the public offering price less the underwriting discount. If any shares are purchased with this option to purchase additional shares, the underwriters will purchase shares in approximately the same proportion as shown in the table above. If any additional shares of common stock are purchased, the underwriters will offer the additional shares on the same terms as those on which the shares are being offered. </p>
<p style="margin-left:10pt;text-indent:-10pt;text-align:justify;"><b>Lock-Up Agreements</b></p><p style="text-align:justify;">We have agreed that during a period of 90 days from the date of this prospectus supplement, we will not, subject to certain exceptions and without the prior written consent of Canaccord Genuity LLC, (i) directly or indirectly, offer, pledge, sell, contract to sell, sell any option or contract to purchase, purchase any option or contract to sell, grant any option, right or warrant to purchase or otherwise transfer or dispose of any shares of our common stock or any securities convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for shares of our common stock or file any registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933 with respect to any of the foregoing or (ii) enter into any swap or any other agreement or any transaction that transfers, in whole or in part, directly or indirectly, the economic consequence of ownership of shares of our common stock, whether any such swap or transaction described in clause (i) or (ii) above is to be settled by delivery of shares of common stock or such other securities, in cash or otherwise, subject to certain exceptions.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">All of our executive officers and directors have agreed that they will not, without the prior written consent of Canaccord Genuity LLC, offer, sell, contract to sell, pledge or otherwise transfer or dispose of (or enter into any transaction which is designed to, or might reasonably be expected to, result in the disposition of (whether by actual disposition or effective economic disposition due to cash settlement or otherwise) by them or any of their affiliates or any person in privity with them or any of their affiliates), directly or indirectly, including the filing (or participation in the filing) of a registration statement with the SEC in respect of, or establish or increase a put equivalent position or liquidate or decrease a call equivalent position within the meaning of Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and the rules and regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder with respect to, any shares of our common stock or any securities convertible into, or exercisable or exchangeable for our common stock, or publicly announce an intention to effect any such transaction, for a period from the date of this prospectus supplement until, and including the date that is, 90 days after the date of this prospectus supplement. Each of the lock-up agreements contains certain exceptions, including the establishment of a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan, provided that (i) such plan does not provide for the transfer of shares of common stock during the 90-day period and (ii) no public announcement or filing under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is required or voluntarily made regarding the establishment of such plan. This lock-up provision applies to shares of our common stock owned now or acquired later by the person executing the agreement or for which the person executing the agreement later acquires the power of disposition. Certain of our executive offices and directors may enter into Rule 10b5-1 trading plans. </p><p style="text-align:justify;">Canaccord Genuity LLC may, in its discretion, release any of the securities subject to these lock-up agreements at any time without notice. </p><p style="margin-left:10pt;text-indent:-10pt;text-align:justify;"><b>Price Stabilization, Short Positions and Penalty Bids</b></p><p style="text-align:justify;">In connection with the offering, the underwriters may purchase and sell our common stock in the open market. These transactions may include over-allotment and stabilizing transactions, passive market making and purchases to cover syndicate short positions created in connection with the offering. Until distribution of the shares of our common stock is completed, SEC rules may limit the underwriters from bidding for and purchasing shares of our common stock. However, the underwriters may engage in transactions that stabilize the price of the shares of our common stock, such as bids or purchases to peg, fix or maintain that price. A "stabilizing transaction" is a bid for or the purchase of common stock on behalf of an underwriter in the open market for the purpose of fixing or maintaining the price of the shares of common stock. Stabilizing transactions may cause the price of shares of our common stock to be higher than the price that might otherwise prevail in the open market. </p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">If an underwriter creates a short position in our common stock in connection with the offering (i.e., if it sells more shares of our common stock than are listed on the cover page of this prospectus supplement), the underwriter may reduce that short position by purchasing shares of our common stock in the open market. A "covering transaction" is the bid for or purchase of common stock on behalf of an underwriter to reduce a short position incurred by the underwriter in connection with the offering. The underwriters may also elect to reduce any short position by exercising all or part of the option to purchase additional shares described above. A short position is more likely to be created if an underwriter is concerned that there may be downward pressure on the price of the shares in the open market after pricing that could adversely affect investors who purchase shares in this offering. Similar to other purchase transactions, an underwriter's purchases to cover the short sales may have the effect of raising or maintaining the market price of our shares or preventing or retarding a decline in the market price of our shares. As a result, the price of our shares may be higher than the price that might otherwise prevail in the open market.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">An underwriter also may impose a penalty bid, whereby the underwriter may reclaim selling concessions allowed to syndicate members or other broker-dealers in respect of the common stock sold in the offering for their account if the underwriter repurchases the shares in stabilizing or covering transactions. These activities may stabilize, maintain or otherwise affect the market price of the common stock, which may be higher than the price that might otherwise prevail in the open market. The imposition of a penalty bid may also affect the price of the shares of our common stock in that it discourages resales of those shares of our common stock.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">In connection with the offering, the underwriters may also engage in passive market making transactions in our common stock on The Nasdaq Capital Market in accordance with Rule 103 of Regulation M during a period before the commencement of offers or sales of shares of our common stock in this offering and extending through the completion of distribution. A passive market maker must display its bid at a price not in excess of the highest independent bid of that security. However, if all independent bids are lowered below the passive market maker's bid, that bid must then be lowered when specified purchase limits are exceeded.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">The underwriters have advised us that these transactions may be effected on The Nasdaq Capital Market or otherwise. Neither we nor the underwriters make any representation or prediction as to the direction or magnitude of any effect that the transactions described above may have on the price of shares of our common stock. In addition, neither we nor the underwriters make any representation that the underwriters will engage in these transactions or that these transactions, once commenced, will not be discontinued without notice.</p><p style="margin-left:10pt;text-indent:-10pt;text-align:justify;"><b>Electronic Distribution </b></p><p style="text-align:justify;">This prospectus supplement and the accompanying prospectus may be made available in electronic format on websites or through other online services maintained by the underwriters of the offering, or by their affiliates.

Our product is produced through an electrolysis process that uses specialized electronic cells coated with a variety of rare earth minerals to produce our 8.8 pH drinking water without the use of any chemicals. Our product also incorporates 84 trace minerals from Himalayan salt. Our product is designed to have a clean smooth taste using only purified water and the Himalayan salt. Consumers drink our water because of the taste profile and the perceived health benefits. We are now one of the largest (by sales volume) alkaline water companies in the United States.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Our product is presently available in all 50 states and the District of Columbia at an estimated 47,500 retail locations, although over 50% of our current sales are concentrated in the Southwest and Texas. We distribute our product through several channels. We sell through large national distributors (UNFI, KeHe, C&S, and Core-Mark). We also sell our product directly to retail clients, including convenience stores, natural food products stores, large ethnic markets and national retailers. Some examples of retail clients are: Walmart, Food Lion, Albertson's, Safeway, Kroger, Schnucks, Smart& Final, Jewel-Osco, Sprouts, Bashas', Stater Bros. Markets, Unified Grocers, Bristol Farms, Vallarta, Superior Foods, Ingles, HEB and Brookshire's. Currently, we sell our product to our retailers through brokers and distributors. Our larger retail clients bring the water in through their own warehouse distribution network. </p></div><hr style="page-break-after: always;" width="100%" size="5" color="black"><a name="page_34"></a><div><div><p style="text-align:center;">- 4 -</p></div><p style="text-align:justify;">We have not yet established an ongoing source of revenues sufficient to cover our operating costs and to allow us to continue as a going concern. As of December 31, 2018, we had an accumulated deficit of $35,858,604. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on our company obtaining adequate capital to fund operating losses until we become profitable. If we are unable to obtain adequate capital, we could be forced to significantly curtail or cease operations. In its report on our financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2018, our independent registered public accounting firm included an explanatory paragraph regarding substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">The principal offices of our company are located at 14646 N.

The information contained on, or that may be accessed through, our corporate website is not part of, and is not incorporated into, this prospectus.</p><p style="text-align:center;"><b>Risk Factors</b></p><p style="text-align:justify;">An investment in our common stock involves a number of very significant risks. You should carefully consider the following risks and uncertainties in addition to other information contained in or incorporated by reference in this prospectus in evaluating our company and our business before making an investment decision about our company. Our business, operating results and financial condition could be seriously harmed as a result of the occurrence of any of the following risks. You could lose all or part of your investment due to any of these risks. </p><p><b>Risks Related to Our Business</b></p><p style="text-align:justify;"><i><b>Because we have a limited operating history, our ability to fully and successfully develop our business is unknown.</b></i></p><p style="text-align:justify;">We were incorporated in June 6, 2011, and we have only begun producing and distributing alkaline bottled water in 2013, and we have a limited operating history from which investors can evaluate our business. Our ability to successfully develop our products, and to realize consistent, meaningful revenues and profit has not been established and cannot be assured. For us to achieve success, our products must receive broad market acceptance by consumers. Without this market acceptance, we will not be able to generate sufficient revenue to continue our business operation. If our products are not widely accepted by the market, our business may fail.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Our ability to achieve and maintain profitability and positive cash flow is dependent upon our ability to generate revenues, manage development costs and expenses, and compete successfully with our direct and indirect competitors. We anticipate operating losses in upcoming future periods. This will occur because there are expenses associated with the development, production, marketing, and sales of our products.</p><p style="text-align:justify;"><i><b>Our independent registered public accounting firm has expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.</b></i></p><p style="text-align:justify;">Our financial statements are prepared using generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America applicable to a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. We have not yet established an ongoing source of revenues sufficient to cover our operating costs and to allow us to continue as a going concern. As of December 31, 2018, we had an accumulated deficit of $35,858,604. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on our company obtaining adequate capital to fund operating losses until we become profitable. If we are unable to obtain adequate capital, we could be forced to significantly curtail or cease operations.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">In its report on our financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2018, our independent registered public accounting firm included an explanatory paragraph regarding substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.</p></div><hr style="page-break-after: always;" width="100%" size="5" color="black"><a name="page_35"></a><div><div><p style="text-align:center;">- 5 -</p></div><p><i><b>We will need additional funds to produce, market, and distribute our products.</b></i></p><p style="text-align:justify;">We will have to spend additional funds to produce, market and distribute our products. If we cannot raise sufficient capital, we may have to cease operations and you could lose your investment. We will need additional funds to produce our products for distribution to our target market. Even after we have produced our products, we will have to spend substantial funds on distribution, marketing and sales efforts before we will know if we have commercially viable and marketable/sellable products.</p><p><i><b>There is no guarantee that sufficient sale levels will be achieved.</b></i></p><p style="text-align:justify;">There is no guarantee that the expenditure of money on distribution and marketing efforts will translate into sufficient sales to cover our expenses and result in profits. Consequently, there is a risk that you may lose all of your investment.</p><p><i><b>Our development, marketing, and sales activities are limited by our size.</b></i></p><p style="text-align:justify;">Because we are small and do not have much capital, we must limit our product development, marketing, and sales activities. As such we may not be able to complete our production and business development program in a manner that is as thorough as we would like. We may not ever generate sufficient revenues to cover our operating and expansion costs and you may, therefore, lose your entire investment.</p><p style="text-align:justify;"><i><b>Changes in the non-alcoholic beverage business environment and retail landscape could adversely impact our financial results.</b></i></p><p style="text-align:justify;">The non-alcoholic beverage business environment is rapidly evolving as a result of, among other things, changes in consumer preferences, including changes based on health and nutrition considerations and obesity concerns; shifting consumer tastes and needs; changes in consumer lifestyles; and competitive product and pricing pressures. In addition, the non-alcoholic beverage retail landscape is very dynamic and constantly evolving, not only in emerging and developing markets, where modern trade is growing at a faster pace than traditional trade outlets, but also in developed markets, where discounters and value stores, as well as the volume of transactions through e-commerce, are growing at a rapid pace. If we are unable to successfully adapt to the rapidly changing environment and retail landscape, our share of sales, volume growth and overall financial results could be negatively affected.</p><p style="text-align:justify;"><i><b>Intense competition and increasing competition in the commercial beverage market could hurt our business.</b></i></p><p style="text-align:justify;">The commercial retail beverage industry, and in particular its non-alcoholic beverage segment, is highly competitive. Market participants are of various sizes, with various market shares and geographical reach, some of whom have access to substantially more sources of capital.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">We compete generally with all liquid refreshments, including bottled water and numerous specialty beverages, such as: Core Hydration, SoBe; Snapple; Arizona Ice Tea; Vitamin Water; Gatorade; and Powerade.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">We compete indirectly with major international beverage companies including but not limited to: the Coca-Cola Company; PepsiCo, Inc.; Nestl&eacute;; Dr Pepper Snapple Group; Groupe Danone; Kraft Foods Group, Inc.; and Unilever. These companies have established market presence in the United States, and offer a variety of beverages that are substitutes to our products. We face potential direct competition from such companies, because they have the financial resources, and access to manufacturing and distribution channels to rapidly enter the alkaline water market. We compete directly with other alkaline water producers and brands focused on the emerging alkaline beverage market including: Eternal; Essentia; Core, Icelandic; Real Water; Aqua Hydrate; Mountain Valley; Qure; Penta; and Alka Power. These companies could bolster their position in the alkaline water market through additional expenditure and promotion.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">As a result of both direct and indirect competition, our ability to successfully distribute, market and sell our products, and to gain sufficient market share in the United States to realize profits may be limited, greatly diminished, or totally diminished, which may lead to partial or total loss of your investments in our company.</p></div><hr style="page-break-after: always;" width="100%" size="5" color="black"><a name="page_36"></a><div><div><p style="text-align:center;">- 6 -</p></div><p style="text-align:justify;"><i><b>Alternative non-commercial beverages or processes could hurt our business.</b></i></p><p style="text-align:justify;">The availability of non-commercial beverages, such as tap water, and machines capable of producing alkaline water at the consumer's home or at store-fronts could hurt our business, market share, and profitability.</p><p style="text-align:justify;"><i><b>Expansion of the alkaline beverage market or sufficiency of consumer demand in that market for operations to be profitable are not guaranteed.</b></i></p><p style="text-align:justify;">The alkaline water market is an emerging market and there is no guarantee that this market will expand or that consumer demand will be sufficiently high to allow our company to successfully market, distribute and sell our products, or to successfully compete with current or future competition, all of which may result in total loss of your investment.</p><p style="text-align:justify;"><i><b>A failure to introduce new products or product extensions into new marketplaces successfully could prevent us from achieving long-term profitability.</b></i></p><p style="text-align:justify;">We compete in an industry characterized by rapid changes in consumer preferences, so our ability to continue developing new products to satisfy our consumers' changing preferences will determine our long-term success. A failure to introduce new products or product extensions into new marketplaces successfully could prevent us from achieving long-term profitability. In addition, customer preferences are also affected by factors other than taste, such as the publicity. If we do not adjust to respond to these and other changes in customer preferences, our sales may be adversely affected. In addition, a failure to obtain any required regulatory approvals for our proposed products could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. </p><p style="text-align:justify;"><i><b>Our growth and profitability depends on the performance of third-parties and our relationship with them.</b></i></p><p style="text-align:justify;">Our distribution network and its success depend on the performance of third parties. Any non-performance or deficient performance by such parties may undermine our operations, profitability, and result in total loss to your investment. To distribute our products, we use a broker-distributor-retailer network whereby brokers represent our products to distributors and retailers who will in turn sell our products to consumers. The success of this network will depend on the performance of the brokers, distributors and retailers of this network. There is a risk that a broker, distributor, or retailer may refuse to or cease to market or carry our products. There is a risk that the mentioned entities may not adequately perform their functions within the network by, without limitation, failing to distribute to sufficient retailers or positioning our products in localities that may not be receptive to our products. Furthermore, such third-parties' financial position or market share may deteriorate, which could adversely affect our distribution, marketing and sale activities. We also need to maintain good commercial relationships with third-party brokers, distributors and retailers so that they will promote and carry our products. Any adverse consequences resulting from the performance of third-parties or our relationship with them could undermine our operations, profitability and may result in total loss of your investment.</p><p style="text-align:justify;"><i><b>The loss of one or more of our major customers or a decline in demand from one or more of these customers could harm our business.</b></i></p><p style="text-align:justify;">We have 2 major customers that together account for 46% (30% and 16%, respectively) of accounts receivable at December 31, 2018, and 2 customers that together account for 43% (24% and 19 %, respectively) of the total revenues earned for the three months ended December 31, 2018.  There can be no assurance that such customers will continue to order our products in the same level or at all. A reduction or delay in orders from such customers, including reductions or delays due to market, economic or competitive conditions, could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.</p><p style="text-align:justify;"><i><b>Our dependence on a limited number of vendors leaves us vulnerable to having an inadequate supply of required products, price increases, late deliveries, and poor product quality. </b></i></p><p style="text-align:justify;">We have three vendors that accounted for 59% (36%, 12% and 11% respectively) of purchases for the three months ended December 31, 2018. Like other companies in our industry, we occasionally experience shortages and are unable to purchase our desired volume of products. Increasingly, our vendors are combining and merging together, leaving us with fewer alternative sources. If we are unable to maintain an adequate supply of products, our revenue and gross profit could suffer considerably. Finally, we cannot provide any assurance that our products will be available in quantities sufficient to meet customer demand. Any limits to product access could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><i><b>Our business is sensitive to public perception.  If any product proves to be harmful to consumers or if scientific studies provide unfavorable findings regarding their safety or effectiveness, then our image in the marketplace would be negatively impacted.</b></i></p><p style="text-align:justify;">Our results of operations may be significantly affected by the public's perception of our company and similar companies. Our business could be adversely affected if any of our products or similar products distributed by other companies proves to be harmful to consumers or if scientific studies provide unfavorable findings regarding the safety or effectiveness of our products or any similar products. If our products suffer from negative consumer perception, it is likely to adversely affect our business and results of operations. </p><p style="text-align:justify;"><i><b>Health benefits of alkaline water is not guaranteed or proven, rather it is perceived by consumers.</b></i></p><p style="text-align:justify;">Health benefits of alkaline water are not guaranteed and have not been proven. There is a consumer perception that drinking alkaline water has beneficial health effects. Consequently, negative changes in consumers' perception of the benefits of alkaline water or negative publicity surrounding alkaline water may result in loss of market share or potential market share and hence loss of your investment.</p><p style="text-align:justify;"><i><b>Water scarcity and poor quality could negatively impact our production costs and capacity.</b></i></p><p style="text-align:justify;">Water is the main ingredient in our products. It is also a limited resource, facing unprecedented challenges from overexploitation, increasing pollution, poor management, and climate change. As demand for water continues to increase, as water becomes scarcer, and as the quality of available water deteriorates, we may incur increasing production costs or face capacity constraints that could adversely affect our profitability or net operating revenues in the long run.</p><p style="text-align:justify;"><i><b>Increase in the cost, disruption of supply or shortage of ingredients, other raw materials or packaging materials could harm our business.</b></i></p><p style="text-align:justify;">We and our bottlers will use water, 84 trace minerals from Himalayan salts, packaging materials for bottles such as plastic and paper products. The prices for these ingredients, other raw materials and packaging materials fluctuate depending on market conditions. Substantial increases in the prices of our or our bottlers' ingredients, other raw materials and packaging materials, to the extent they cannot be recouped through increases in the prices of finished beverage products, would increase our operating costs and could reduce our profitability. Increases in the prices of our finished products resulting from a higher cost of ingredients, other raw materials and packaging materials could affect the affordability of our products and reduce sales.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">An increase in the cost, a sustained interruption in the supply, or a shortage of some of these ingredients, other raw materials, or packaging materials and containers that may be caused by a deterioration of our or our bottlers' relationships with suppliers; by supplier quality and reliability issues; or by events such as natural disasters, power outages, labor strikes, political uncertainties or governmental instability, or the like, could negatively impact our net revenues and profits. </p><p style="text-align:justify;"><i><b>Changes in laws and regulations relating to beverage containers and packaging could increase our costs and reduce demand for our products.</b></i></p><p style="text-align:justify;">We and our bottlers intend to offer our products in non-refillable, recyclable containers in the United States. Legal requirements have been enacted in various jurisdictions in the United States requiring that deposits or certain ecotaxes or fees be charged for the sale, marketing and use of certain non-refillable beverage containers. Other proposals relating to beverage container deposits, recycling, ecotax and/or product stewardship have been introduced in various jurisdictions in the United States and overseas, and we anticipate that similar legislation or regulations may be proposed in the future at local, state and federal levels in the United States. Consumers' increased concerns and changing attitudes about solid waste streams and environmental responsibility and the related publicity could result in the adoption of such legislation or regulations. If these types of requirements are adopted and implemented on a large scale in the geographical regions in which we operate or intend to operate, they could affect our costs or require changes in our distribution model, which could reduce our net operating revenues or profitability.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><i><b>Significant additional labeling or warning requirements or limitations on the availability of our products may inhibit sales of affected products.</b></i></p><p style="text-align:justify;">Various jurisdictions may seek to adopt significant additional product labeling or warning requirements or limitations on the availability of our products relating to the content or perceived adverse health consequences of our products. If these types of requirements become applicable to our products under current or future environmental or health laws or regulations, they may inhibit sales of our products. </p><p style="text-align:justify;"><i><b>Unfavorable general economic conditions in the United States could negatively impact our financial performance.</b></i></p><p style="text-align:justify;">Unfavorable general economic conditions, such as a recession or economic slowdown, in the United States could negatively affect the affordability of, and consumer demand for, our products in the United States. Under difficult economic conditions, consumers may seek to reduce discretionary spending by forgoing purchases of our products or by shifting away from our beverages to lower-priced products offered by other companies, including non-alkaline water. Consumers may also cease purchasing bottled water and consume tap water. Lower consumer demand for our products in the United States could reduce our profitability.</p><p style="text-align:justify;"><i><b>Adverse weather conditions could reduce the demand for our products.</b></i></p><p style="text-align:justify;">The sales of our products are influenced to some extent by weather conditions in the markets in which we operate. Unusually cold or rainy weather during the summer months may have a temporary effect on the demand for our products and contribute to lower sales, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations for such periods.</p><p style="text-align:justify;"><i><b>Changes in, or failure to comply with, the laws and regulations applicable to our products or our business operations could increase our costs or reduce our net operating revenues.</b></i></p><p style="text-align:justify;">The advertising, distribution, labeling, production, safety, sale, and transportation in the United States of our products will be subject to: the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act; the Federal Trade Commission Act; the Lanham Act; state consumer protection laws; competition laws; federal, state, and local workplace health and safety laws, such as the Occupational Safety and Health Act; various federal, state and local environmental protection laws; and various other federal, state, and local statutes and regulations. Legal requirements also apply in many jurisdictions in the United States requiring that deposits or certain ecotaxes or fees be charged for the sale, marketing, and use of certain non-refillable beverage containers. The precise requirements imposed by these measures vary. Other types of statutes and regulations relating to beverage container deposits, recycling, ecotaxes and/or product stewardship also apply in various jurisdictions in the United States. We anticipate that additional, similar legal requirements may be proposed or enacted in the future at the local, state and federal levels in the United States. Changes to such laws and regulations could increase our costs or reduce our net operating revenues.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">In addition, failure to comply with environmental, health or safety requirements and other applicable laws or regulations could result in the assessment of damages, the imposition of penalties, suspension of production, changes to equipment or processes, or a cessation of operations at our or our bottlers' facilities, as well as damage to our image and reputation, all of which could harm our profitability.</p></div><hr style="page-break-after: always;" width="100%" size="5" color="black"><a name="page_39"></a><div><div><p style="text-align:center;">- 9 -</p></div><p style="text-align:justify;"><i><b>Our products are considered premium and healthy beverages and are being sold at premium prices compared to our competitors; we cannot provide any assurances as to consumers' continued market acceptance of our current and future products.</b></i></p><p style="text-align:justify;">We will compete directly with other alkaline water producers and brands focused on the emerging alkaline beverage market including Eternal, Essentia, Core, Icelandic, Real Water, Aqua Hydrate, Mountain Valley, Qure, Penta, and Alka Power. Products offered by our direct competitors are sold in various volumes and prices with prices ranging from approximately $0.99 for a half-liter bottle to $4.99 for a one-gallon bottle, and volumes ranging from half-liter bottles to one-gallon bottles. We currently offer our product in a one-gallon bottle for an SRP of $4.99, three-liter bottle for an SRP of $3.99, 1.5 liter at an SRP of $2.49, 1 liter at an SRP of $1.99, 700 milliliter single serving at an SRP of $1.19, and a 500 milliliter at an SRP of $0.99. Our competitors may introduce larger sizes and offer them at an SRP that is lower than our products. We can provide no assurances that consumers will continue to purchase our products or that they will not prefer to purchase a competitive product. </p><p style="text-align:justify;"><i><b>If the water or flavors we sell became contaminated, our business could be seriously harmed.</b></i></p><p style="text-align:justify;">We have adopted various quality, environmental, health and safety standards. However, our products may still not meet these standards or could otherwise become contaminated.  A failure to meet these standards or contamination could occur in our operations or those of our bottlers, distributors or suppliers.  Such a failure or contamination could result in expensive production interruptions, recalls and liability claims.  Moreover, negative publicity could be generated even from false, unfounded or nominal liability claims or limited recalls.  Any of these failures or occurrences could negatively affect our business and financial performance.</p><p style="text-align:justify;"><i><b>We are subject to periodic claims and litigation that could result in unexpected expenses and could ultimately be resolved against us.</b></i></p><p style="text-align:justify;">From time to time, we are involved in litigation and other proceedings, including matters related to product liability claims, stockholder class action and derivative claims, commercial disputes and intellectual property, as well as trade, regulatory, employment, and other claims related to our business. Any of these proceedings could result in significant settlement amounts, damages, fines or other penalties, divert financial and management resources, and result in significant legal fees. An unfavorable outcome of any particular proceeding could exceed the limits of our insurance policies or the carriers may decline to fund such final settlements and/or judgments and could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. In addition, any proceeding could negatively impact our reputation among our guests and our brand image.</p><p style="text-align:justify;"><i><b>Our inability to protect our trademarks and trade secrets may prevent us from successfully marketing our products and competing effectively. </b></i></p><p style="text-align:justify;">Failure to protect our intellectual property could harm our brand and our reputation, and adversely affect our ability to compete effectively. Further, enforcing or defending our intellectual property rights, including our trademarks, copyrights, licenses and trade secrets, could result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources. We regard our intellectual property, particularly our trademarks to be of considerable value and importance to our business and our success. We rely on a combination of trademark laws, confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our intellectual property rights. There can be no assurance that the steps taken by us to protect these proprietary rights will be adequate or that third parties will not infringe or misappropriate our trademarks, trade secrets or similar proprietary rights. In addition, there can be no assurance that other parties will not assert infringement claims against us, and we may have to pursue litigation against other parties to assert our rights. Any such claim or litigation could be costly. In addition, any event that would jeopardize our proprietary rights or any claims of infringement by third parties could have a material adverse effect on our ability to market or sell our products.</p></div><hr style="page-break-after: always;" width="100%" size="5" color="black"><a name="page_40"></a><div><div><p style="text-align:center;">- 10 -</p></div><p style="text-align:justify;"><i><b>We regularly evaluate potential expansion into international markets, and any expansion into such international operations could subject us to risks and expenses that could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. </b></i></p><p style="text-align:justify;">To date, we have not undertaken substantial commercial activities outside of the United States. We have evaluated, and continue to evaluate, potential expansion into certain other international markets. If and when we seek to expand internationally in the future, our sales and operations would be subject to a variety of risks, including fluctuations in currency exchange rates, tariffs, import restrictions and other trade barriers, unexpected changes in legal and regulatory requirements, longer accounts receivable payment cycles, potentially adverse tax consequences, and difficulty in complying with foreign laws and regulations, as well as U.S. laws and regulations that govern foreign activities. Economic uncertainty in some of the geographic regions in which we might operate could result in the disruption of commerce and negatively impact our operations in those areas. Also, if we choose to pursue international expansion efforts, it may be necessary or desirable to contract with third parties, and we may not be able to enter into such agreements on commercially acceptable terms or at all. Further, such arrangements may not perform to our expectations, and we may be exposed to various risks as a result of the activities of our partners.</p><p style="text-align:justify;"><i><b>We rely on key executive officers, and their knowledge of our business would be difficult to replace. </b></i></p><p style="text-align:justify;">We are highly dependent on our two executive officers, Richard A. Wright and David A. Guarino. We do not have "key person" life insurance policies for any of our officers. The loss of management and industry expertise of any of our key executive officers could result in delays in product development, loss of any future customers and sales and diversion of management resources, which could adversely affect our operating results.</p><p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Risk Related to Our Stock</b></p><p style="text-align:justify;"><i><b>Because we can issue additional shares of common stock, our stockholders may experience dilution in the future.</b></i></p><p style="text-align:justify;">We are authorized to issue up to 200,000,000 shares of common stock and 100,000,000 shares of preferred stock, of which 34,656,829 shares of common stock are issued and outstanding,1,500,000 shares of Series C Preferred Stock are issued and outstanding, and 3,800,000 shares of Series D Preferred Stock are issued and outstanding as of February 15, 2019. Our board of directors has the authority to cause us to issue additional shares of common stock and preferred stock, and to determine the rights, preferences and privileges of shares of our preferred stock, without consent of our stockholders. Consequently, the stockholders may experience more dilution in their ownership of our stock in the future.</p><p style="text-align:justify;"><i><b>Trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market or TSX Venture Exchange may be volatile, which could depress the market price of our common stock and make it difficult for our stockholders to resell their shares.</b></i></p><p style="text-align:justify;">Our common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market and the TSX Venture Exchange. Trading of our common stock may experience wide fluctuations in trading prices, due to many factors that may have little to do with our operations or business prospects. This volatility could depress the market price of our common stock for reasons unrelated to operating performance. </p><p style="text-align:justify;"><i><b>A decline in the price of our common stock could affect our ability to raise further working capital, it may adversely impact our ability to continue operations and we may go out of business.</b></i></p><p style="text-align:justify;">A prolonged decline in the price of our common stock could result in a reduction in the liquidity of our common stock and a reduction in our ability to raise capital. Because we plan to acquire a significant portion of the funds we need in order to conduct our planned operations through the sale of equity securities, a decline in the price of our common stock could be detrimental to our liquidity and our operations because the decline may cause investors not to choose to invest in our stock. If we are unable to raise the funds we require for all our planned operations, we may be forced to reallocate funds from other planned uses and may suffer a significant negative effect on our business plan and operations, including our ability to develop new products and continue our current operations. As a result, our business may suffer, and not be successful and we may go out of business. We also might not be able to meet our financial obligations if we cannot raise enough funds through the sale of our equity securities and we may be forced to go out of business.</p>

As of February 15, 2019, we had approximately 53 stockholders of record. Therefore, we believe that these provisions governing combination of a Nevada corporation do not apply to us and will not until such time as these requirements have been met. At such time as they may apply to us, these provisions may also have effect of delaying or making it more difficult to effect a change in control of our company.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">A corporation affected by these provisions may not engage in a combination within three years after the interested stockholder acquires his, her or its shares unless the combination or purchase is approved by the board of directors before the interested stockholder acquired such shares. Generally, if approval is not obtained, then after the expiration of the three-year period, the business combination may be consummated with the approval of the board of directors before the person became an interested stockholder or a majority of the voting power held by disinterested stockholders, or if the consideration to be received per share by disinterested stockholders is at least equal to the highest of:</p><ul type="disc" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="margin-top:12pt;margin-left:27.6pt;text-align:justify;padding-left:8.4pt;">the highest price per share paid by the interested stockholder within the three years immediately preceding the date of the announcement of the combination or within three years immediately before, or in, the transaction in which he, she or it became an interested stockholder, whichever is higher;</li><li style="margin-top:12pt;margin-left:27.6pt;text-align:justify;padding-left:8.4pt;">the market value per share on the date of announcement of the combination or the date the person became an interested stockholder, whichever is higher; or</li><li style="margin-top:12pt;margin-left:27.6pt;text-align:justify;padding-left:8.4pt;">if higher for the holders of preferred stock, the highest liquidation value of the preferred stock, if any.</li></ul><p style="text-align:justify;">Generally, these provisions define an interested stockholder as a person who is the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly of 10% or more of the voting power of the outstanding voting shares of a corporation. Generally, these provisions define combination to include any merger or consolidation with an interested stockholder, or any sale, lease, exchange, mortgage, pledge, transfer or other disposition, in one transaction or a series of transactions with an interested stockholder of assets of the corporation having:</p><ul type="disc" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="margin-top:12pt;margin-left:27.6pt;text-align:justify;padding-left:8.4pt;">an aggregate market value equal to 5% or more of the aggregate market value of the assets of the corporation; </li><li style="margin-top:12pt;margin-left:27.6pt;text-align:justify;padding-left:8.4pt;">an aggregate market value equal to 5% or more of the aggregate market value of all outstanding shares of the corporation; or </li><li style="margin-top:12pt;margin-left:27.6pt;text-align:justify;padding-left:8.4pt;">representing 10% or more of the earning power or net income of the corporation.</li></ul><p style="text-align:justify;"><i><b>Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws</b></i></p><p style="text-align:justify;">There are no provisions in our articles of incorporation or our bylaws that would delay, defer or prevent a change in control of our company and that would operate only with respect to an extraordinary corporate transaction involving our company, such as merger, reorganization, tender offer, sale or transfer of substantially all of its assets, or liquidation.</p><p style="text-align:center;"><b>Description of Debt Securities</b></p><p style="text-align:justify;">The following describes the general terms and provisions of the debt securities we may offer. When we offer to sell particular debt securities, we will describe the specific terms of any debt securities offered from time to time in a supplement to this prospectus, which may supplement or change the terms outlined below.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">We may issue secured or unsecured and senior or subordinated debt securities. Particular debt securities may have different terms. The senior debt securities will be issued under one or more senior indentures, dated as of a date prior to such issuance, between us and a trustee to be named in a prospectus supplement, as amended or supplemented from time to time. Any subordinated debt securities will be issued under one or more subordinated indentures, dated as of a date prior to such issuance, between us and a trustee to be named in a prospectus supplement, as amended or supplemented from time to time. The indentures will be subject to and governed by the United States Trust Indenture Act of 1939. </p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>By Agents</b></p><p style="text-align:justify;">We may sell the securities directly or through agents we designate from time to time. </p><p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Direct Sales</b></p><p style="text-align:justify;">We may sell the securities directly at such prices and upon such terms as agreed to by us and the purchaser. In this case, no underwriters, dealers or agents would be involved in the offering.</p><p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Compensation of Underwriters, Dealers or Agents</b></p><p style="text-align:justify;">In connection with the sale of the securities, underwriters, dealers or agents may receive compensation from us or from purchasers of the securities for whom they act as agents in the form of discounts, concessions or commissions. Underwriters may sell the securities to or through dealers, and those dealers may receive compensation in the form of discounts, concessions or commissions from the underwriters or commissions from the purchasers for whom they may act as agents. Underwriters, dealers and agents that participate in the distribution of the securities, and any institutional investors or others that purchase securities directly and then resell the securities, may be deemed to be underwriters, and any discounts or commissions received by them from us and any profit on the resale of the securities by them may be deemed to be underwriting discounts and commissions under the United States Securities Act of 1933.</p><p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Delayed Delivery Contracts</b></p><p style="text-align:justify;">We may authorize agents or underwriters to solicit offers by institutional investors to purchase securities from us at the public offering price set forth in the prospectus supplement pursuant to delayed delivery contracts providing for payment and delivery on a specified date in the future. We will describe the conditions to these contracts and the commissions we must pay for solicitation of these contracts in the prospectus supplement.</p><p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Stabilization and Other Transactions </b></p><p style="text-align:justify;">To facilitate the offering of securities, certain persons participating in the offering may engage in transactions that stabilize, maintain or otherwise affect the price of the securities. This may include over-allotments or short sales of the securities, which involve the sale by persons participating in the offering of more securities that we sell to them. In these circumstances, these persons would cover such over-allotments or short positions by exercising their over-allotment option, if any, or making purchases in the open market. In addition, these persons may stabilize or maintain the price of the securities by bidding for or purchasing securities in the open market or by imposing penalty bids, whereby selling concessions allowed to dealers participating in the offering may be reclaimed if securities sold by them are repurchased in connection with stabilization transactions. The effect of these transactions may be to stabilize or maintain the market price of the securities at a level above that which might otherwise prevail in the open market. These transactions may be discontinued at any time. </p><p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Derivative Transactions and Hedging </b></p><p style="text-align:justify;">We, the underwriters or other agents may engage in derivative transactions involving the securities. These derivatives may consist of short sale transactions and other hedging activities. The underwriters or agents may acquire a long or short position in the securities, hold or resell the securities acquired and purchase options or futures on the securities and other derivative instruments with returns linked to or related to changes in the price of the securities. In order to facilitate these derivative transactions, we may enter into security lending or repurchase agreements with the underwriters or agents. The underwriters or agents may effect the derivative transactions through sales of the securities to the public, including short sales, or by lending the securities in order to facilitate short sale transactions by others. The underwriters or agents may also use the securities purchased or borrowed from us or others (or, in the case of derivatives, securities received from us in settlement of those derivatives) to directly or indirectly settle sales of the securities or close out any related open borrowings of the securities.</p>
