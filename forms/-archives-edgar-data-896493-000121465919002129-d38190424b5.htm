<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">On March 14, 2019, the stockholders approved
a proposal permitting the Board of Directors to file an amendment to the Company&rsquo;s Certificate of Incorporation (the &ldquo;<B>Certificate
of Incorporation</B>&rdquo;) to effect a reverse stock split (the &ldquo;<B>Reverse Split</B>&rdquo;) of its issued and outstanding
Class A common stock, $0.001 par value (&ldquo;<B>Common Stock</B>&rdquo;) by a ratio of not less than one-for-four and not more
than one-for-twenty at any time prior to March 14, 2020, with the ratio to be set at a whole number within this range as determined
by the Board of Directors in its sole discretion in a certificate of Amendment to the Certificate of Incorporation (the &ldquo;<B>Amendment</B>&rdquo;).</P>

of Directors approved the Amendment, which effectuated the Reverse Split with a ratio of one for twenty. The Reverse Split did
not affect the number of <FONT STYLE="background-color: white">authorized shares of Common Stock or their par value per share.
As a result of the Reverse Split and the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding was reduced </FONT>from approximately 125,080,765
to approximately 6,254,038. The Reverse Split became effective in the State of Delaware on March 14, 2019. Beginning on March 15,
2019, the Common Stock traded on the NYSE American on a split-adjusted basis.</P>

20 shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding prior to the Reverse Split has been converted into one share of Common Stock,
and all options, warrants, and any other similar instruments convertible into, or exchangeable or exercisable for, shares of Common
Stock have been proportionally adjusted. All references to Common Stock in this Prospectus Supplement have been retroactively restated.</P>

maturity date of the promissory note to December 22, 2018;&nbsp;however, since payment was not made on the specified maturity
date this unsecured 12% promissory note is currently in default. Interest only payments are due, in arrears, on a monthly basis
commencing on April 23, 2018. The exercise price of the warrant is $23.00 per share. The promissory note is unsecured by any of
our assets but is personally guaranteed by our Chief Executive Officer.</P>

we entered into three securities purchase agreements with certain institutional investors to sell, for an aggregate purchase price
of $1,550,000, 12% convertible notes with an aggregate principal face amount of $1,722,222, warrants to purchase an aggregate of
49,679 shares of our common stock, and an aggregate of&nbsp;10,046 commitment shares. The 12% convertible notes bore simple interest
at 12% on the principal amount with a guarantee of interest during the initial six months in the amount of $103,333. Subject to
certain beneficial ownership limitations and an event of default having occurred and not been cured, the investors could convert
the principal amount of the 12% convertible notes and accrued interest earned thereon into shares of our common stock at $14.00
per share, subject to adjustment for customary stock splits, stock dividends, combinations or similar events. Beginning on May
16, 2018, we were required to make six monthly cash payments in the aggregate amount of $304,259 until the 12% convertible notes
were satisfied in full, which was to occur on October 16, 2018. The entire amount of principal and interest on these 12% convertible
notes has been paid. The warrants entitle the holders to purchase, in the aggregate, up to 49,679 shares of our common stock at
an exercise price of $26.00 per share for a period of five years from April 16, 2018 subject to certain beneficial ownership limitations.
In connection with these three securities purchase agreements, we entered into security agreements pursuant to which we granted

instruments and inventory, and all proceeds, as set forth in the security agreements.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">We have historically experienced
operating and net losses and anticipate continuing to experience such losses in the future. For the years ended December 31, 2017
and 2016, we had an operating loss of approximately $5,983,000 and $1,219,000 and net losses of approximately $10,895,000 and $1,122,000,
respectively. As of December 31, 2017, we had a working capital deficiency of approximately $2,235,000 and as of September 30,
2018, we had a working capital deficiency of approximately $9,744,000. There are no assurances that we will be able to achieve
a level of revenues adequate to generate sufficient cash flow from operations or obtain additional financing through private placements,
public offerings and/or bank financing necessary to support our working capital requirements. To the extent that funds generated
from any private placements, public offerings and/or bank financing are insufficient, we will have to raise additional working
capital. No assurance can be given that additional financing will be available, or if available, will be on acceptable terms. These
conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. If adequate working capital is not available
we may be forced to discontinue operations, which would cause investors to lose their entire investment.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in; background-color: white">We
expect to continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future and need to raise additional capital to continue business development
initiatives and to support our working capital requirements. For example, in March 2017, we were awarded a 3-year, $50 million
purchase order by MTIX Ltd. (&#8220;MTIX&#8221;) to manufacture, install and service the Multiplex Laser Surface Enhancement (&#8220;MLSE&#8221;)
plasma-laser system. We believe that the MLSE purchase order will be a source of revenue and generate significant cash flows for
us. However, if we are unable to raise additional capital, we may be required to curtail operations and take additional measures
to reduce costs, including reducing our workforce, eliminating outside consultants and reducing legal fees in order to conserve
cash in amounts sufficient to sustain operations and meet our obligations. As a result of these financing uncertainties, during
the third quarter ended September 30, 2017, we recognized that our dependence on ongoing capital requirements to fund our operations
raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our ongoing capital requirements have only increased
since then, meaning that substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern remains and will likely do so for the
foreseeable future.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in; background-color: white">Until
we are profitable, we will need to quickly raise additional capital in order to fund our operations in furtherance of our business
plan. The proposed financing may include shares of common stock, shares of preferred stock, warrants to purchase shares of common
stock or preferred stock, debt securities, units consisting of the foregoing securities, equity investments from strategic development
partners or some combination of each. Any additional equity financings may be financially dilutive to, and will be dilutive from
an ownership perspective to our stockholders, and such dilution may be significant based upon the size of such financing. Additionally,
we cannot assure that such funding will be available on a timely basis, in needed quantities, or on terms favorable to us, if at
all.</P>

results based upon our historical data. Reliance on our historical results may not be representative of the results we will achieve,
and for certain areas in which we operate, principally those unrelated to defense contracting, will not be indicative at all. Because
of the uncertainties related to our lack of historical operations, we may be hindered in our ability to anticipate and timely adapt
to increases or decreases in sales, product costs or expenses. If we make poor budgetary decisions as a result of unreliable historical
data, we could be less profitable or incur losses, which may result in a decline in our stock price.</P>

evolved in the past and continues to do so. In prior years we have added additional types of services and product offerings and
in some cases we have modified or discontinued those offerings. We intend to continue to try to offer additional types of products
or services, and we do not know whether any of them will be successful. From time to time we have also modified aspects of our
business model relating to our product mix. We do not know whether these or any other modifications will be successful. The additions
and modifications to our business have increased the complexity of our business and placed significant strain on our management,
personnel, operations, systems, technical performance, financial resources, and internal financial control and reporting functions.
Future additions to or modifications of our business are likely to have similar effects. Further, any new business or website we
launch that is not favorably received by the market could damage our reputation or our brand. The occurrence of any of the foregoing
could have a material adverse effect on our business.</P>

commitments then in place to meet expected cash requirements. Our ability to continue as a going concern is subject to our ability
to generate a profit and/or obtain necessary funding from outside sources, including obtaining additional funding from the sale
of our securities, increasing sales or obtaining loans and grants from various financial institutions where possible. If we do

growth strategy through acquisitions is fraught with risk. On June 2, 2017, we acquired a majority interest in Microphase Corp.
(&#8220;Microphase&#8221;) and on May 23, 2018, we acquired Enertec Systems 2001 Ltd. (&#8220;Enertec&#8221;). Our strategy and
business plan is dependent on our ability to successfully integrate Microphase&#8217;s, Enertec&#8217;s and our other acquisition&#8217;s
operations. In addition, while we are based in Fremont, CA, Microphase&#8217;s operations are located in Shelton, Connecticut,
Enertec&#8217;s operations are located in Karmiel, Israel and Digital Power Limited&#8217;s (doing business as Gresham Power) operations
are located in Salisbury, England. These distant locations and others that we may become involved with in the future will stretch
our resources and management time. Further, failure to quickly and adequately integrate
all of these operations and personnel could adversely affect our combined business and our ability to achieve our objectives and
strategy. No assurance can be given that we will realize synergies in the areas we currently operate.</P>

in the past been subject to quarter-to-quarter fluctuations, and we expect that these fluctuations will continue, and may increase
in magnitude, in future periods. Demand for our products is driven by many factors, including the availability of funding for our
products in our customers&#8217; capital budgets. There is a trend for some of our customers to place large orders near the end
of a quarter or fiscal year, in part to spend remaining available capital budget funds. Seasonal fluctuations in customer demand
for our products driven by budgetary and other concerns can create corresponding fluctuations in period-to-period revenues, and
we therefore cannot assure you that our results in one period are necessarily indicative of our revenues in any future period.
In addition, the number and timing of large individual sales and the ability to obtain acceptances of those sales, where applicable,
have been difficult for us to predict, and large individual sales have, in some cases, occurred in quarters subsequent to those
we anticipated, or have not occurred at all. The loss or deferral of one or more significant sales in a quarter could harm our
operating results for such quarter. It is possible that, in some quarters, our operating results will be below the expectations
of public market analysts or investors. In such events, or in the event adverse conditions prevail, the market price of our common

An inadvertent investment company can avoid being classified as an investment company if it can rely on one of the exclusions under
the 1940 Act. One such exclusion, Rule 3a-2 under the 1940 Act, allows an inadvertent investment company a grace period of one
year from the earlier of (a) the date on which an issuer owns securities and/or cash having a value exceeding 50% of the issuer&#8217;s
total assets on either a consolidated or unconsolidated basis and (b) the date on which an issuer owns or proposes to acquire investment
securities having a value exceeding 40% of the value of such issuer&#8217;s total assets (exclusive of government securities and
cash items) on an unconsolidated basis. We are putting in place policies that we expect will work to keep the investment securities

certain investments or enter into joint ventures that could otherwise have a positive impact on our earnings. In any event, we

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">We may securitize assets
to generate cash for funding new investments. We refer to the term securitize to describe a form of leverage under which a company
(sometimes referred to as an &#8220;originator&#8221; or &#8220;sponsor&#8221;) transfers income producing assets to a single-purpose,
bankruptcy-remote subsidiary (also referred to as a &#8220;special purpose entity&#8221; or &#8220;SPE&#8221;), which is established
solely for the purpose of holding such assets and entering into a structured finance transaction. The SPE would then issue notes
secured by such assets. The special purpose entity may issue the notes in the capital markets either publicly or privately to a
variety of investors, including banks, non-bank financial institutions and other investors. There may be a single class of notes
or multiple classes of notes, the most senior of which carries less credit risk and the most junior of which may carry substantially
the same credit risk as the equity of the SPE.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">An important aspect of
most debt securitization transactions is that the sale and/or contribution of assets into the SPE be considered a true sale and/or
contribution for accounting purposes and that a reviewing court would not consolidate the SPE with the operations of the originator
in the event of the originator's bankruptcy based on equitable principles. Viewed as a whole, a debt securitization seeks to lower
risk to the note purchasers by isolating the assets collateralizing the securitization in an SPE that is not subject to the credit
and bankruptcy risks of the originator. As a result of this perceived reduction of risk, debt securitization transactions frequently
achieve lower overall leverage costs for originators as compared to traditional secured lending transactions.</P>

above description, to securitize loans, we may create a wholly owned subsidiary and contribute a pool of our assets to such subsidiary.
The SPE may be funded with, among other things, whole loans or interests from other pools and such loans may or may not be rated.
The SPE would then sell its notes to purchasers whom we would expect to be willing to accept a lower interest rate and the absence
of any recourse against us to invest in a pool of income producing assets to which none of our creditors would have access. We
would retain all or a portion of the equity in the SPE. An inability to successfully securitize portions of our portfolio or otherwise
leverage our portfolio through secured and unsecured borrowings could limit our ability to grow our business and fully execute
our business strategy, and could decrease our earnings, if any. However, the successful securitization of portions of our portfolio
exposes us to a risk of loss for the equity we retain in the SPE and might expose us to greater risk on our remaining portfolio
because the assets we retain may tend to be those that are riskier and more likely to generate losses. A successful securitization
may also impose financial and operating covenants that restrict our business activities and may include limitations that could
hinder our ability to finance additional loans and investments. The 1940 Act may also impose restrictions on the structure of any
securitizations.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">Interests we hold in the
SPE, if any, will be subordinated to the other interests issued by the SPE. As such, we will only receive cash distributions on
such interests if the SPE has made all cash interest and other required payments on all other interests it has issued. In addition,
our subordinated interests will likely be unsecured and rank behind all of the secured creditors, known or unknown, of the SPE,
including the holders of the senior interests it has issued. Consequently, to the extent that the value of the SPE's portfolio
of assets has been reduced as a result of conditions in the credit markets, or as a result of defaults, the value of the subordinated
interests we retain would be reduced. Securitization imposes on us the same risks as borrowing except that our risk in a securitization
is limited to the amount of subordinated interests we retain, whereas in a borrowing or debt issuance by us directly we would be
at risk for the entire amount of the borrowing or debt issuance.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">We may also engage in transactions
utilizing SPEs and securitization techniques where the assets sold or contributed to the SPE remain on our balance sheet for accounting
purposes. If, for example, we sell the assets to the SPE with recourse or provide a guarantee or other credit support to the SPE,
its assets will remain on our balance sheet. Consolidation would also generally result if we, in consultation with the SEC, determine
that consolidation would result in a more accurate reflection of our assets, liabilities and results of operations. In these structures,
the risks will be essentially the same as in other securitization transactions but the assets will remain our assets for purposes
of the limitations described above on investing in assets that are not qualifying assets and the leverage incurred by the SPE will
be treated as borrowings incurred by us for purposes of our limitation on the issuance of senior securities.</P>

reform legislation known colloquially as the &#8220;Tax Cuts and Jobs Act,&#8221; among other things, makes significant changes
to the rules applicable to the taxation of corporations, such as changing the corporate tax rate to a flat 21% rate, modifying
the rules regarding limitations on certain deductions for executive compensation, introducing a capital investment deduction in
certain circumstances, placing certain limitations on the interest deduction, modifying the rules regarding the usability of certain
net operating losses, implementing a minimum tax on the &#8220;global intangible low-taxed income&#8221; of a &#8220;United States
shareholder&#8221; of a &#8220;controlled foreign corporation,&#8221; modifying certain rules applicable to United States shareholders
of controlled foreign corporations, imposing a deemed repatriation tax on certain earnings and adding certain anti-base erosion
rules.&nbsp; We are currently in the process of analyzing the effects of this new legislation on us and at this time the ultimate
outcome of the new legislation on our business and financial condition is uncertain.&nbsp; It is possible that the application
of these new rules may have a material and adverse impact on our operating results, cash flows and financial condition.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify"><B>Technology changes rapidly in our business,
and if we fail to anticipate new technologies, the quality, timeliness and competitiveness of our products will suffer.</B></P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">Rapid technology changes
in our industry require us to anticipate, sometimes years in advance, which technologies and/or distribution platforms our products
must take advantage of in order to make them competitive in the market at the time they are released. Therefore, we usually start
our product development with a range of technical development goals that we hope to be able to achieve. We may not be able to achieve
these goals, or our competition may be able to achieve them more quickly than we can. In either case, our products may be technologically
inferior to competitive products, or less appealing to consumers, or both. If we cannot achieve our technology goals within the
original development schedule of our products, then we may delay products until these technology goals can be achieved, which may
delay or reduce revenue and increase our development expenses. Alternatively, we may increase the resources employed in research
and development in an attempt to accelerate our development of new technologies, either to preserve our product launch schedule
or to keep up with our competition, which would increase our development expenses and adversely affect our operations and financial
condition.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify"><B>We are dependent upon our ability, and our

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">Because of the global economy,
many raw material vendors have reduced capacities, closed production lines and, in some cases, even discontinued their operations.
As a result, there is a global shortage of certain electronic or mineral components, which may extend our production lead-time
and our production costs. Some materials are no longer available to support some of our products, thereby requiring us to search
for cross materials or, even worse, redesign some of our products to support currently-available materials. Such redesign efforts
may require certain regulatory and safety agency re-submittals, which may cause further production delays. While we have initiated
actions that we believe will limit our exposure to such problems, the dynamic business conditions in many of our markets may challenge
the solutions that have been put in place, and issues may recur in the future.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">In addition, some of our
products are manufactured, assembled and tested by third party subcontractors and contract manufacturers located in Asia. While
we have had relationships with many of these third parties in the past, we cannot predict how or whether these relationships will
continue in the future. In addition, changes in management, financial viability, manufacturing demand or capacity, or other factors,
at these third parties could hurt our ability to manufacture our products.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">As a result of our strategic
focus on custom power supply solutions, we will continue to devote significant resources to developing and manufacturing custom
power supply solutions for a large number of customers, where each product represents a uniquely tailored solution for a specific
customer&#8217;s requirements. Failure to meet these customer product requirements or a failure to meet production schedules and/or
product quality standards may put us at risk with one or more of these customers. Moreover, changes in market conditions and strategic
changes at the direction of our customers may affect their decision to continue to purchase from us. The loss of one or more of
our significant custom power supply solution customers
could have a material adverse impact on our revenues, business or financial condition.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">We have also implemented
a series of initiatives designed to increase efficiency and reduce costs. While we believe that these actions will reduce costs,
they may not be sufficient to achieve the required operational efficiencies that will enable us to respond more quickly to changes
in the market or result in the improvements in our business that we anticipate. In such event, we may be forced to take additional
cost-reducing initiatives, including those involving our personnel, which may negatively impact quarterly earnings and profitability
as we account for severance and other related costs. In addition, there is the risk that such measures could have long-term adverse
effects on our business by reducing our pool of talent, decreasing or slowing improvements in our products or services, making
it more difficult for us to respond to customers, limiting our ability to increase production quickly if and when the demand for
our solutions increases and limiting our ability to hire and retain key personnel. These circumstances could cause our earnings
to be lower than they otherwise might be.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">We currently depend upon
a few major OEMs and other customers for a significant portion of our revenues. If our major OEM customers will reduce or cancel
their orders scaling back some of their activities, our revenues and net income would be significantly reduced. Furthermore, diversions
in the capital spending of certain of these customers to new network elements have and could continue to lead to their reduced
demand for our products, which could, in turn, have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. If the
financial condition of one or more of our major customers should deteriorate, or if they have difficulty acquiring investment capital
due to any of these or other factors, a substantial decrease in our revenues would likely result. We are dependent on the electronic
equipment industry, and accordingly will be affected by the impact on that industry of current economic conditions.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">Substantially all of our
existing customers are in the electronic equipment industry, and they manufacture products that are subject to rapid technological
change, obsolescence, and large fluctuations in demand. This industry is further characterized by intense competition and volatility.
The OEMs serving this industry are pressured for increased product performance and lower product prices. OEMs, in turn, make similar
demands on their suppliers, such as us, for increased product performance and lower prices. Such demands may adversely affect our
ability to successfully compete in certain markets or our ability to sustain our gross margins.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify"><B>Our reliance on subcontract manufacturers

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">Since we do not own significant
manufacturing facilities, we must rely on, and will continue to rely on, a limited number of subcontract manufacturers to manufacture
our power supply products. Our reliance upon such subcontract manufacturers involves several risks, including reduced control over
manufacturing costs, delivery times, reliability and quality of components, unfavorable currency exchange fluctuations, and continued
inflationary pressures on many of the raw materials used in the manufacturing of our power supply products. If we were to encounter
a shortage of key manufacturing components from limited sources of supply, or experience manufacturing delays caused by reduced
manufacturing capacity, inability of our subcontract manufacturers to procure raw materials, the loss of key assembly subcontractors,
difficulties associated with the transition to our new subcontract manufacturers or other factors, we could experience lost revenues,
increased costs, and delays in, or cancellations or rescheduling of, orders or shipments, any of which would materially harm our
business.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">We made an operational
decision to outsource some of our custom design products to numerous developer partners. This business structure will remain in
place until the custom design volume justifies expanding our in house capabilities. Incomplete product designs that do not fully
comply with the customer specifications and requirements might affect our ability to transition to a volume production stage of
the custom designed product where the revenue goals are dependent on the high volume of custom product production. Furthermore,
we rely on the design partners&#8217; ability to provide high quality prototypes of the designed product for our customer approval
as a critical stage to approve production.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">We operate in an industry
that is generally characterized by intense competition. We believe that the principal bases of competition in our markets are breadth
of product line, quality of products, stability, reliability and reputation of the provider, along with cost. Quantity discounts,
price erosion, and rapid product obsolescence due to technological improvements are therefore common in our industry as competitors
strive to retain or expand market share. Product obsolescence can lead to increases in unsaleable inventory that may need to be
written off and, therefore, could reduce our profitability. Similarly, price erosion can reduce our profitability by decreasing
our revenues and our gross margins. In fact, we have seen price erosion over the last several years on most of the products we
sell, and we expect additional price erosion in the future.</P>

as well as with manufacturers&#8217; representatives and distributors to sell our products. If, however, the third parties with
whom we have entered into such OEM and other arrangements should fail to meet their contractual obligations, cease doing, or reduce
the amount of their, business with us or otherwise fail to meet their own performance objectives, customer demand for our products

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">The power supply industry,
and the electronics industry as a whole, can be subject to business cycles. During periods of growth and high demand for our products,
we may not have adequate supplies of inventory on hand to satisfy our customers' needs. Furthermore, during these periods of growth,
our suppliers may also experience high demand and, therefore, may not have adequate levels of the components and other materials
that we require to build products so that we can meet our customers' needs. Our inability to secure sufficient components to build
products for our customers could negatively impact our sales and operating results. We may choose to mitigate this risk by increasing
the levels of inventory for certain key components. Increased inventory levels can increase the potential risk for excess and obsolescence
should our forecasts fail to materialize or if there are negative factors impacting our customers&#8217; end markets. If we purchase
too much inventory or the wrong inventory, we may have to record additional inventory reserves or write-off the inventory, which
could have a material adverse effect on our gross margins and on our results of operations.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">A relatively large portion
of our sales have historically been attributable to our legacy products. We expect that these products may continue to account
for a meaningful percentage of our revenues for the foreseeable future. However, these sales are declining. Although we are unable
to predict future prices for our legacy products, we expect that prices for these products will continue to be subject to significant
downward pressure in certain markets for the reasons described above. Accordingly, our ability to maintain or increase revenues
will be dependent on our ability to expand our customer base, to increase unit sales volumes of these products and to successfully,
develop, introduce and sell new products such as custom design and value added products. We cannot assure you that we will be able

our cryptocurrency business, which is pursuing a variety of digital currency. We anticipate mining the top ten cryptocurrencies
for our own account. These include Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin and Ethereum, along with other currencies that we consider to
be in the top ten by market capitalization. Virtually every state in the U.S. regulates money transmitters and money services businesses.
In some states the licensing requirements and regulations expressly cover companies engaged in digital currency activities; in
other states it is not clear whether or how the existing laws and regulations apply to digital currency activities. Further, U.S.
federal law requires registration of most such businesses with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (&#8220;FinCEN&#8221;).
These licenses and registrations subject companies to various anti-money laundering, know-your-customer, record-keeping, reporting
and capital and bonding requirements, limitations on the investment of customer funds, and inspection by state and federal regulatory
agencies. Under U.S. federal law, it is a crime for a person, entity or business that is required to be registered with FinCEN
or licensed in any state to fail to do so, even if the person, entity or business was unaware of the licensing requirement. Further,
under U.S. federal law, anyone who owns all or part of an unlicensed money transmitting business is subject to civil and criminal
penalties. The business in which we have invested has represented to us that it has not taken any action that could subject it
to registration with FinCEN or to the licensing requirements in any state and has agreed that it will not do so until it has become
properly licensed in all required states and registered with FinCEN. However, if the business makes an error, even inadvertently,
we could be subject to potential civil and criminal penalties as a result. Any such penalties, or even the allegation of criminal
activities, could have a material adverse effect on us and our business. Further, all of our foreign business activities expose
us to a variety of risks, including risks under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.</P>

or no regulatory attention has been directed toward cryptocurrency and the cryptocurrency networks by U.S. federal and state governments,
foreign governments, and self-regulatory agencies. As cryptocurrency has grown in popularity and in market size, the Federal Reserve
Board, U.S. Congress, and certain U.S. agencies (e.g., FinCEN and the Federal Bureau of Investigation) have begun to examine the
operations of cryptocurrency networks, cryptocurrency users, and cryptocurrency exchange markets. Local state regulators such as
the California Department of Financial Institutions and the New York State Department of Financial Services have also initiated
examinations of Bitcoins, the Bitcoin Network, and the regulation thereof. Additionally, a U.S. federal magistrate judge in the
U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas has ruled that &#8220;Bitcoin is a currency or form of money,&#8221; two
CFTC commissioners publicly expressed a belief that derivatives based on Bitcoins are subject to the same regulation as those based
on commodities, and the IRS released guidance treating cryptocurrency as property that is not currency for U.S. federal income
tax purposes, although there is no indication yet whether other courts or federal or state regulators will follow these asset classifications.
There is a possibility of future regulatory change altering, perhaps to a material extent, the nature of an investment in us or
our ability to continue to operate.</P>

SEC nor the CFTC has formally asserted regulatory authority over cryptocurrency, cryptocurrency networks, or cryptocurrency trading
and ownership, though in testimony before the U.S. Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry on December 10, 2014,
CFTC Chairman Timothy Massad stated that the CFTC believed it had jurisdiction over derivative instruments such as futures and
swaps based on digital currencies. On July 25, 2017, the SEC issued an investigative report, stating that offers and sales of digital
assets by &#8220;virtual&#8221;&nbsp;organizations using distributed ledger or cryptocurrency technology (i.e., Initial Coin Offerings
or Token Sales) are subject to the requirements of the federal securities laws. Furthermore, the SEC has raised concerns with instances
of public companies changing their business models to reflect a focus on cryptocurrency or blockchain technology and is looking
closely at the disclosures of public companies that shift their business models to capitalize on the perceived promise of distributed
ledger technology and whether the disclosures comply with the federal securities laws, particularly in the context of a securities
offering, and in a few instances halted the trading of companies. To the extent that Bitcoins, Ethereum, or Litecoins, themselves
are determined to be a security, commodity future or other regulated asset, or to the extent that a US or foreign government or

faces an uncertain regulatory landscape in not only the United States but also in many foreign jurisdictions such as the European
Union, China and Russia. While certain governments such as Germany&#8212;where the Ministry of Finance has declared Bitcoins to
be &#8220;Rechnungseinheiten&#8221; (a form of private money that is recognized as a unit of account, but not recognized in the
same manner as fiat currency) &#8212; have issued guidance as to how to treat bitcoins and/or other cryptocurrencies, most regulatory
bodies have not yet issued official statements regarding intention to regulate or determinations on regulation of cryptocurrency,
the cryptocurrency networks, and cryptocurrency users. Among those for which preliminary guidance has been issued in some form,
Canada and Taiwan have labeled cryptocurrency as a digital or virtual currency, distinct from fiat currency, while Sweden and Norway
are among those to categorize cryptocurrency as a form of virtual asset or commodity. In China, authorities have recently banned
use of bitcoins and/or other cryptocurrencies and ordered Beijing-based cryptocurrency exchanges to cease trading and immediately
notify users of their closures. Similarly, Russia has indicated an intention to ban use of bitcoins and/or other cryptocurrencies
and Russia&#8217;s Central Bank stated that at this stage they will not approve any cryptocurrency trading on any official exchange,
nor will it approve the use of the technology for infrastructure purposes. In May 2014, the Central Bank of Bolivia banned the
use of Bitcoins as a means of payment. In the summer and fall of 2014, Ecuador announced plans for its own state-backed electronic
money, while passing legislation that reportedly prohibits the use of decentralized digital currencies. Conversely, regulatory
bodies in some countries such as India and Switzerland have declined to exercise regulatory authority when afforded the opportunity.
Various foreign jurisdictions may, in the near future, adopt laws, regulations, or directives that affect cryptocurrency networks
and its users, particularly cryptocurrency exchanges and service providers that fall within such jurisdictions&#8217; regulatory
scope. Other countries such as Malaysia and Australia have been considering regulation, classification, and potential bans. Such
laws, regulations, or directives may conflict with those of the United States and may negatively impact the acceptance of cryptocurrency
by users, merchants, and service providers outside of the United States and may, therefore, impede the growth of the cryptocurrency
economy.</P>

cryptocurrency prices will result in further tightening of profit margins, particularly for professionalized crypto mining operations
with higher costs and more limited capital reserves, creating a network effect that may further reduce the price of cryptocurrency

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in; background-color: white">Over
the years, crypto mining operations have evolved from individual users mining with computer processors, graphics processing units
and first generation application-specific integrated circuit (&#8220;ASIC&#8221;) servers. Currently, new processing power is predominantly
added by incorporated and unincorporated &#8220;professionalized&#8221; crypto mining operations. Professionalized crypto mining
operations may use proprietary hardware or sophisticated ASIC machines acquired from ASIC manufacturers. They require the investment
of significant capital for the acquisition of this hardware, the leasing of operating space (often in data centers or warehousing
facilities), incurring of electricity costs and the employment of technicians to operate the cryptocurrency mining farms.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in; background-color: white">As
a result, professionalized crypto mining operations are of a greater scale than prior miners and have more defined, regular expenses
and liabilities. These regular expenses and liabilities require professionalized crypto mining operations to more immediately sell
cryptocurrencies earned from crypto mining operations, whereas it is believed that individual miners in past years were more likely
to hold newly mined bitcoins and/or other cryptocurrencies for more extended periods. The immediate selling of newly mined bitcoins
and/or other cryptocurrencies greatly increases the supply of bitcoins and/or other cryptocurrencies for sale, creating downward
pressure on the price of bitcoins and/or other cryptocurrencies.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in; background-color: white">The
extent to which the value of bitcoins and/or other cryptocurrencies mined by a professionalized crypto mining operation exceeds
the allocable capital and operating costs determines the profit margin of such operation. A professionalized crypto mining operation
may be more likely to sell a higher percentage of its newly mined bitcoins and/or other cryptocurrencies rapidly if it is operating
at a low profit margin&#8212;and it may partially or completely cease operations if its profit margin is negative. In a low profit
margin environment, a higher percentage could be sold more rapidly, thereby potentially reducing bitcoin and/or other cryptocurrencies
prices. Lower bitcoin and/or other cryptocurrencies prices could result in further tightening of profit margins, particularly for
professionalized crypto mining operations with higher costs and more limited capital reserves, creating a network effect that may
further reduce the price of bitcoin until crypto mining operations with higher operating costs become unprofitable and remove mining
power. The network effect of reduced profit margins resulting in greater sales of newly mined bitcoins and/or other cryptocurrencies
could result in a reduction in the price of bitcoins and/or other cryptocurrencies that could adversely impact business of Digital
Farms, Inc. and our company.</P>

replacement from time to time and new technological innovations could render our current equipment obsolete at any time. Shortages
of graphics processing units may lead to unnecessary downtime for miners and limit the availability or accessibility of cryptocurrency

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">During the past three fiscal
years Microphase has incurred losses from operations. These losses are attributable to lower volumes of its products sold to major
defense contractors partially as a result of the overall reduction in defense spending and sequestration by the U.S. Congress.
As of June 30, 2017, Microphase had an accumulated deficit of approximately $18 million.&nbsp; Since the financial crisis of 2008,
Microphase has been significantly short of capital needed to acquire parts for production of its products to complete orders for
such products. At times, Microphase has not had the cash available to make advance payments for the purchase of parts, and then,
as a consequence, Microphase would not receive the parts from its vendors required to finish a customer order. This would then
delay the delivery of products to customers, and would also delay recognition of the resulting revenues and the receipt of cash
from the customer. Sometimes after experiencing a delay in delivery of an order from Microphase, the customer would not place its
next order with Microphase, resulting in a loss of business.</P>

is incurring significant legal, accounting, and other expenses related to being a reporting company without there being a trading
market for any of its securities. As a result of these expenditures, Microphase will have to generate and sustain increased revenue
to achieve and maintain future profitability.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify"><B>A large percentage of Microphase&#8217;s
current revenue is derived from prime defense contractors to the U.S. government and its allies, and the loss of these relationships,

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">Microphase is highly dependent
on sales to major defense contractors of the U.S. military and its allies, including Lockheed Martin, Raytheon, BAE Systems and
SAAB. The percentages of its revenue that were derived from sales to these named major defense contractors and directly to the
U.S. Government were 61.9% in fiscal 2017, 66.8% in fiscal 2016, 65.8% in fiscal 2015, 56.1% in fiscal 2014 and 48.4% in fiscal
2013. Therefore, any significant disruption or deterioration of Microphase&#8217;s relationship with any such major defense contractors
or the U.S. Government could materially reduce its revenue.&nbsp; In the twelve months ended June 30, 2017 there were three customers
that accounted for more than 10% of sales:&nbsp; BAE Systems, Saab and Aselsan.&nbsp; In the twelve months ended June 30, 2016
there were two customers that accounted for more than 10% of sales: Lockheed Martin and BAE Systems. Microphase&#8217;s competitors
continuously engage in efforts to expand their business relationships with the same major defense contractors and the U.S. Government
and will continue these efforts in the future, and the U.S. Government may choose to use other contractors. Microphase expects
that a majority of the business that it seeks will be awarded through competitive bidding. Microphase operates in highly competitive
markets and its competitors have more extensive or more specialized engineering, manufacturing and marketing capabilities than
Microphase does in many areas, and Microphase may not be able to continue to win competitively awarded contracts or to obtain task
orders under multi-award contracts. Further, the competitive bidding process involves significant cost and managerial time to prepare
bids and proposals for contracts that may not be awarded to Microphase, as well as the risk that Microphase may fail to accurately
estimate the resources and costs required to fulfill any contract awarded to us. Following any contract award, Microphase may experience
significant expense or delay, contract modification or contract rescission as a result of its competitors protesting or challenging
contracts awarded to it in competitive bidding. Major defense contractors to whom Microphase supplies components for systems must
compete with other major defense contractors (to which Microphase
may not supply components) for military orders from the U.S. Government.</P>

policy needs, which may be viewed as more necessary, for limited resources and an ever-changing amount of available funding in
the budget and appropriation process. Budget and appropriations decisions made by the U.S. Government are outside of Microphase
control and have long-term consequences for its business. U.S. Government spending priorities and levels remain uncertain and difficult
to predict and are affected by numerous factors, including until recently sequestration (automatic, across-the-board U.S. Government
budgetary spending cuts), and the purchase of our products could be superseded by alternate arrangements. While the US defense
budget was recently increased, there can be no assurance that this increase will be maintained for the foreseeable future. A change
in U.S. Government spending priorities or an increase in non-procurement spending at the expense of our programs, or a reduction
in total U.S. Government spending, could have material adverse consequences on Microphase&#8217;s future business.&nbsp;</P>

can terminate or modify any of its contracts with Microphase or its prime contractors either for the federal government&#8217;s

A termination arising out of Microphase&#8217;s default could expose it to liability and have a material adverse effect on its

United States Export Administration regulations control technology exports like its products for reasons of national security and
compliance with foreign policy, to guarantee domestic reserves of products in short supply and, under certain circumstances, for
the security of a destination country. Thus, any foreign sales of its products requiring export licenses must comply with these

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">Over its lifetime, a U.S.
Government program awarded to a major defense contractor may be implemented by the award of many different individual contracts
and subcontracts. The funding of U.S. Government programs is subject to Congressional appropriations. Although multi-year contracts
may be authorized and appropriated in connection with major procurements, Congress generally appropriates funds on a fiscal year
basis. Procurement funds are typically made available for obligations over the course of one to three years. Consequently, programs
often receive only partial funding initially, and additional funds are designated only as Congress authorizes further appropriations.
The termination of funding for a U.S. Government program with respect to major defense contractors for which Microphase is a subcontractor
would result in a loss of anticipated future revenue attributable to that program, which could have an adverse impact on its operations.
In addition, the termination of, or failure to commit additional funds to, a program for which Microphase is a subcontractor
could result in lost revenue and increase its overall costs of doing business.</P>

contracts are subject to oversight audits by U.S. Government representatives. Such audits could result in adjustments to Microphase&#8217;s
contract costs. Any costs found to be improperly allocated to a specific contract will not be reimbursed, and such costs already
reimbursed must be refunded. Microphase has recorded contract revenues based on costs Microphase expect to realize upon final audit.
However, Microphase does not know the outcome of any future audits and adjustments, and Microphase may be required to materially
reduce its revenues or profits upon completion and final negotiation of audits. Negative audit findings could also result in termination
of a contract, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspension or debarment from U.S. Government contracting
or subcontracting for a period of time.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">In addition, U.S. Government
contracts generally contain provisions permitting termination, in whole or in part, without prior notice at the U.S. Government&#8217;s
convenience upon the payment only for work done and commitments made at the time of termination. Microphase can give no assurance
that one or more of the U.S. Government contracts with a major defense contractor under which Microphase provides component products
will not be terminated under these circumstances. Also, Microphase can give no assurance that it will be able to procure new contracts
to offset the revenue or backlog lost as a result of any termination of its U.S. Government contracts. Because a significant portion
of Microphase&#8217;s revenue is dependent on its performance and payment under its U.S. Government contracts, the loss of one
or more large contracts could have a material adverse impact on its business, financial condition, results of operations and cash
flows.&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">Microphase&#8217;s government
business also is subject to specific procurement regulations and other requirements. These requirements, though customary in U.S.
Government contracts, increase its performance and compliance costs. In addition, these costs might increase in the future, thereby
reducing Microphase&#8217;s margins, which could have an adverse effect on its business, financial condition, results of operations
and cash flows. Failure to comply with these regulations and requirements could lead to fines, penalties, repayments, or compensatory
or treble damages, or suspension or debarment from U.S. Government contracting or subcontracting for a period of time. Among the
causes for debarment are violations of various laws, including those related to procurement integrity, export control, U.S. Government
security regulations, employment practices, protection of the environment, accuracy of records, proper recording of costs and foreign
corruption. The termination of a U.S. Government contract or relationship as a result of any of these acts would have an adverse
impact on Microphase&#8217;s operations and could have an adverse effect on its standing and eligibility for future U.S. Government
contracts.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">As a U.S. Government defense
contractor, Microphase faces certain security threats, including threats to its information technology infrastructure, attempts
to gain access to its proprietary or classified information, threats to physical security, and domestic terrorism events. Microphase&#8217;s
information technology networks and related systems are critical to the operation of its business and essential to its ability
to successfully perform day-to-day operations. Microphase is also involved with information technology systems for certain customers
and other third parties, which generally face similar security threats. Cybersecurity threats in particular, are persistent, evolve
quickly and include, but are not limited to, computer viruses, attempts to access information, denial of service and other electronic
security breaches. Microphase believes that it has implemented appropriate measures and controls and has invested in skilled information
technology resources to appropriately identify threats and mitigate potential risks, but there can be no assurance that such actions
will be sufficient to prevent disruptions to mission critical systems, the unauthorized release of confidential information or
corruption of data. A security breach or other significant disruption involving these types of information and information technology
networks and related systems could:</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">Microphase has a number
of fixed-price contracts which allow it to benefit from cost savings but subject it to the risk of potential cost overruns, particularly
for firm fixed-price contracts, because Microphase assumes the entire cost burden. If its initial estimates are incorrect, Microphase
can lose money on these contracts. U.S. Government contracts can expose Microphase to potentially large losses because the U.S.
Government can hold Microphase responsible for completing a project or, in certain circumstances, paying the entire cost of its
replacement by another provider regardless of the size or foreseeability of any cost overruns that occur over the life of the contract.
Because many of these contracts involve new technologies and applications, unforeseen events such as technological difficulties,
fluctuations in the price of raw materials, problems with its suppliers and cost overruns, can result in the contractual price
becoming less favorable or even unprofitable to Microphase. The U.S. and other countries also may experience a significant increase
in inflation. A significant increase in inflation rates could have a significant adverse impact on the profitability of these contracts.
Furthermore, if Microphase does not meet contract deadlines or specifications, Microphase may need to renegotiate contracts on
less favorable terms, be forced to pay penalties or liquidated damages or suffer major losses if the customer exercises its right
to terminate. In addition, some of its contracts have provisions relating to cost controls and audit rights, and if Microphase
fails to meet the terms specified in those contracts Microphase may not realize their full benefits. Microphase&#8217;s results
of operations are dependent on its ability to maximize its earnings from its contracts. Cost overruns could have an adverse impact
on its financial results.&nbsp;</P>

American continued listing standards because our reported stockholders' equity was below continued listing standards. The NYSE
American requires that a listed company's stockholders' equity be $4.0 million or more if it has reported losses from continuing
operations and/or net losses in three of its four most recent fiscal years. Subsequently, the NYSE American informed us that we
are required to attain stockholders&#8217; equity of $6.0 million or more because we experienced a loss for the year ended December

submission of our compliance plan demonstrating how we intend to regain compliance with the continued listing standards, we were
notified on March 9, 2016, that the NYSE American granted us a listing extension on the basis of our plan until June 19, 2017.
We are subject to periodic review by NYSE American staff during the extension period. Failure to make progress consistent with
the plan or to regain compliance with the continued listing standards by the end of the extension period could result in our common
stock being delisted from the NYSE American.</P>

on a pro-forma basis. In a letter dated June 20, 2017, the NYSE American notified us that we had successfully regained compliance
with the NYSE American continued listing standards. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in light of our continue losses, there is no
assurance that we will be able to continue to meet the NYSE American continued
listing standard. Failure to meet the NYSE American listing requirement, we may be subject to delisting by the NYSE American. In
the event our common stock is no longer listed for trading on the NYSE American, our trading volume and share price may decrease
and we may experience further difficulties in raising capital which could materially affect our operations and financial results.</P>

that certain personnel changes to our board of directors and executive officers were effective October 6, 2017. On November 6,
2017, we filed an amendment to the above referenced Form 8-K that disclosed that the personnel changes had not in fact occurred.
After discussion with the NYSE American, on November 8, 2017, we filed a subsequent Form 8-K that further clarified that we had

On November 28, 2017, our Board of Directors approved the issuance of cash compensation, and 10,000 shares of common stock and
warrants to purchase 50,000 shares of common stock subject to vesting and shareholder approval, to Mr. William Horne, a director
of our company, for services. As a result of this compensation, Mr. Horne may not be deemed independent within the meaning of Section
803A(2) of the NYSE American Company Guide. Mr. Horne has resigned from the audit committee of the Board of Directors. Robert Smith

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">We are a public company
and subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. The Exchange Act requires, among
other things, that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and financial condition. The Sarbanes-Oxley
Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls for financial
reporting. For example, Section&nbsp;404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires that our management report on the effectiveness of
our internal controls structure and procedures for financial reporting. Section&nbsp;404 compliance may divert internal resources
and will take a significant amount of time and effort to complete.&nbsp;If we fail to maintain compliance under Section 404, or
if in the future management&nbsp;determines that our internal control over financial reporting are not effective as defined under
Section&nbsp;404, we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the NYSE American should we in the future be listed on
this market, the Commission, or other regulatory authorities. Furthermore, investor perceptions of our company may suffer, and
this could cause a decline in the market price of our common stock. Any failure of our internal controls could have a material
adverse effect on our stated results of operations and harm our reputation. If we are unable to implement these changes effectively
or efficiently, it could harm our operations, financial reporting or financial results and could result in an adverse opinion on
internal controls from our independent auditors. We may need to hire a number of additional employees with public accounting and
disclosure experience in order to meet our ongoing obligations as a public company, particularly if we become fully subject to
Section 404 and its auditor attestation requirements, which will increase costs. Our management team and other personnel will need
to devote a substantial amount of time to new compliance initiatives and to meeting the obligations that are associated with being
a public company, which may divert attention from other business concerns, which could have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition and results of operations.</P>

contains a provision permitting us to eliminate the personal liability of our directors to us and our stockholders for damages

indemnification obligations under any future employment agreements with our officers. The foregoing indemnification obligations
could result in us incurring substantial expenditures to cover the cost of settlement or damage awards against directors and officers,
which we may be unable to recoup. These provisions and the resulting costs may also discourage us from bringing a lawsuit against
directors and officers for breaches of their fiduciary duties, and may similarly discourage the filing of derivative litigation

securities is speculative and involves a high degree of risk. Our business, financial condition or results of operations could
be adversely affected by any of these risks. You should carefully consider the following factors as well as the other information
contained in this prospectus, in any supplement to this prospectus and in the other reports that we file with the Commission and
that we incorporate by reference into this prospectus, before deciding to invest in our securities. The risks and uncertainties
we have described are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently
deem immaterial may also affect our operations. Past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance,
and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods. If any of these risks actually occurs,
our business, business prospects, financial condition or results of operations could be seriously harmed. This could cause the
trading price of our shares of common stock to decline, resulting in a loss of all or part of your investment. Please also read
carefully the section below entitled &#8220;Forward-Looking Statements.&#8221;</P>

operating and net losses, and anticipate continuing to experience such losses in the future. For the nine months ended September

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">We expect to continue to incur losses for
the foreseeable future and need to raise additional capital to continue business development initiatives and to support our working
capital requirements. In March 2017, we were awarded a 3-year, $50 million purchase order by MTIX Ltd. (&#8220;<B>MTIX</B>&#8221;)
to manufacture, install and service the Multiplex Laser Surface Enhancement (&#8220;<B>MLSE</B>&#8221;) plasma-laser system. We
believe that the MLSE purchase order will be a source of revenue and generate significant cash flows for us. However, if we are
unable to raise additional capital, we may be required to curtail operations and take additional measures to reduce costs, including
reducing our workforce, eliminating outside consultants and reducing legal fees in order to conserve cash in amounts sufficient
to sustain operations and meet our obligations. As a result of these financing uncertainties, during the third quarter ended September
30, 2017, we recognized that our dependence on ongoing capital requirements to fund our operations raise substantial doubt about
our ability to continue as a going concern.</P>

2015, we were notified by the NYSE American that we were no longer in compliance with the NYSE American continued listing standards
because our reported stockholders' equity was below continued listing standards. The NYSE American requires that a listed company's
stockholders' equity be $4.0 million or more if it has reported losses from continuing operations and/or net losses in three of
its four most recent fiscal years. Subsequently, the NYSE American informed us that we are required to attain stockholders&#8217;
equity of $6.0 million or more because we experienced a loss for the year ended December 31, 2016.</P>

approved the issuance of cash compensation, and 200,000 shares of common stock and warrants to purchase 1,000,000 shares of common

this compensation, Mr. Horne may not be deemed independent within the meaning of Section 803A(2) of the NYSE American Company Guide.
Mr. Horne has resigned from the audit committee of the Board of Directors. Robert Smith has been appointed as chair of the audit

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">In January 2016, Telkoor, a prior affiliate,
sold its entire commercial assets to Advice which included without limitation product IP, manufacturing rights, customer base,
inventory, staff and technological capabilities. Following such transaction, we entered into a manufacturing and distribution agreement
with Advice. This agreement allows us to manufacture certain Advice products (formerly owned by Telkoor) through August 2017 against
royalty payments. From August 2017 through December 2020, subject to Advice's consent, we will be allowed to continue distributing
and selling certain Advice products while keeping product branding under our brand, after which we will be entitled to distribute

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">We depend on Advice to design and retain
up to date product technology and for manufacturing capabilities for certain of the products that we sell. If Advice is unable
or unwilling to continue designing or manufacturing our products in required volumes and with a certain level of quality on a timely
basis, that could lead to loss of sales and adversely affect our operating results and cash position. We also depend on Advice's
intellectual property and ability to transfer production to third party manufacturers. Failure to obtain new products in a timely
manner or delay in delivery of products to customers will have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our customers&#8217; expectations.
In addition, we operate in highly competitive markets where our ability to sell Advice&#8217;s products could be adversely affected
by Advice's agreements with third parties, long lead-times and the high cost of Advice&#8217;s products. Also, in 2012, Telkoor&#8217;s
products manufacturing lead-times increased, which hindered our ability to respond to our customers&#8217; needs in timely manner.
Advice's principal offices, research and development and manufacturing facilities are located in Israel. Political, economic&nbsp;and
military conditions in Israel directly affect Advice operations. We are also dependent upon Advice&#8217;s terms and conditions
with its contract manufacturers for some of our products, which terms and conditions may not always be in our best interest. In
2010, we purchased certain IP from Telkoor in order to reduce our dependency on Telkoor with respect to a certain line of products.
We also entered into a Manufacturing Rights Agreement with Advice in 2016, pursuant to which we were granted the non-exclusive
right to directly place purchase orders for certain products from a third-party manufacturer in consideration for payment of royalties
to Advice. This agreement currently accounts for a significant portion of our sales. In the event this agreement is terminated
for any reason, it would materially affect our financial position.</P>

material vendors have reduced capacities, closed production lines and, in some cases, even discontinued their operations. As a
result, there is a global shortage of certain electronic components, which has extended our production lead-time and our production
costs. Some materials are no longer available to support some of our products, thereby requiring us to search for cross materials
or, even worse, redesign some of our products to support currently-available materials. Such redesign efforts may require certain
regulatory and safety agency re-submittals, which may cause further production delays. While we have initiated actions that we
believe will limit our exposure to such problems, the dynamic business conditions in many of our markets may challenge the solutions
that have been put in place, and issues may recur in the future.</P>

by reducing our pool of talent, decreasing or slowing improvements in our products or services, making it more difficult for us

and other customers for a significant portion of our revenues. If our major OEM customers reduce or cancel their orders scaling
back some of their activities, our revenues and net income would be significantly reduced. Furthermore, diversions in the capital
spending of certain of these customers to new network elements have and could continue to lead to their reduced demand for our
products, which could, in turn, have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. If the financial condition
of one or more of our major customers should deteriorate, or if they have difficulty acquiring investment capital due to any of
these or other factors, a substantial decrease in our revenues would likely result.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">Substantially all of our existing customers
are in the electronic equipment industry, and they manufacture products that are subject to rapid technological change, obsolescence&nbsp;and
large fluctuations in demand. This industry is further characterized by intense competition and volatility. The OEMs serving this
industry are pressured for increased product performance and lower product prices. OEMs, in turn, make similar demands on their
suppliers, such as us, for increased product performance and lower prices. Such demands may adversely affect our ability to successfully
compete in certain markets or our ability to sustain our gross margins.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">Since we do not own significant manufacturing
facilities, we must rely on, and will continue to rely on, a limited number of subcontract manufacturers to manufacture our power
supply products. Our reliance upon such subcontract manufacturers involves several risks, including reduced control over manufacturing
costs, delivery times, reliability and quality of components, unfavorable currency exchange fluctuations&nbsp;and continued inflationary
pressures on many of the raw materials used in the manufacturing of our power supply products. If we were to encounter a shortage
of key manufacturing components from limited sources of supply, or experience manufacturing delays caused by reduced manufacturing
capacity, inability of our subcontract manufacturers to procure raw materials, the loss of key assembly subcontractors, difficulties
associated with the transition to our new subcontract manufacturers or other factors, we could experience lost revenues, increased
costs, and delays in, or cancellations or rescheduling of, orders or shipments, any of which would materially harm our business.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">We operate in an industry that is generally
characterized by intense competition. We believe that the principal bases of competition in our markets are breadth of product
line, quality of products, stability, reliability and reputation of the provider, along with cost. Quantity discounts, price erosion&nbsp;and
rapid product obsolescence due to technological improvements are therefore common in our industry as competitors strive to retain
or expand market share. Product obsolescence can lead to increases in unsaleable inventory that may need to be written off and,
therefore, could reduce our profitability. Similarly, price erosion can reduce our profitability by decreasing our revenues and
our gross margins. In fact, we have seen price erosion over the last several years on most of the products we sell, and we expect
additional price erosion in the future.</P>

we have entered into such OEM and other arrangements should fail to meet their contractual obligations, cease doing, or reduce
the amount of their&nbsp;business with us or otherwise fail to meet their own performance objectives, customer demand for our products

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">The power supply industry, and the electronics
industry as a whole, can be subject to business cycles. During periods of growth and high demand for our products, we may not have
adequate supplies of inventory on hand to satisfy our customers' needs. Furthermore, during these periods of growth, our suppliers
may also experience high demand and, therefore, may not have adequate levels of the components and other materials that we require
to build products so that we can meet our customers' needs. Our inability to secure sufficient components to build products for
our customers could negatively impact our sales and operating results. We may choose to mitigate this risk by increasing the levels
of inventory for certain key components. Increased inventory levels can increase the potential risk for excess and obsolescence
should our forecasts fail to materialize or if there are negative factors impacting our customers&#8217; end markets. If we purchase
too much inventory or the wrong inventory, we may have to record additional inventory reserves or write-off the inventory, which
could have a material adverse effect on our gross margins and on our results of operations.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">A relatively large portion of our sales
have historically been attributable to our legacy products. We expect that these products may continue to account for a meaningful
percentage of our revenues for the foreseeable future. However, these sales are declining. Although we are unable to predict future
prices for our legacy products, we expect that prices for these products will continue to be subject to significant downward pressure
in certain markets for the reasons described above. Accordingly, our ability to maintain or increase revenues will be dependent
on our ability to expand our customer base, to increase unit sales volumes of these products and to successfully, develop, introduce
and sell new products such as custom design and value added products. We cannot assure you that we will be able to expand our customer
base, increase unit sales volumes of existing products or develop, introduce and/or sell new products.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">Our operating results have in the past
been subject to quarter-to-quarter fluctuations, and we expect that these fluctuations will continue, and may increase in magnitude,
in future periods. Demand for our products is driven by many factors, including the availability of funding for our products in
our customers&#8217; capital budgets. There is a trend for some of our customers to place large orders near the end of a quarter
or fiscal year, in part to spend remaining available capital budget funds. Seasonal fluctuations in customer demand for our products
driven by budgetary and other concerns can create corresponding fluctuations in period-to-period revenues, and we therefore cannot
assure you that our results in one period are necessarily indicative of our revenues in any future period. In addition, the number
and timing of large individual sales and the ability to obtain acceptances of those sales, where applicable, have been difficult
for us to predict, and large individual sales have, in some cases, occurred in quarters subsequent to those we anticipated, or
have not occurred at all. The loss or deferral of one or more significant sales in a quarter could harm our operating results for
such quarter. It is possible that, in some quarters, our operating results will be below the expectations of public market analysts
or investors. In such events, or in the event adverse conditions prevail, the market price of our common stock may decline significantly.</P>

a substantial number of shares that are subject to issuance pursuant to outstanding convertible debt, warrants and options. These
conversion prices and exercise prices range from $0.01 to $1.69 per share of common stock. As of January 2, 2018, the number of
shares of common stock subject to convertible notes, warrants and options were 1,283,940, 7,133,828 and 3,877,500 respectively.
The issuance of common stock pursuant to convertible notes, warrants and options at conversion or exercise prices less than market
prices may have the effect of limiting an increase in market price of our common stock until all of these underling shares have
been issued.</P>

of a series of securities, persons participating in the offering may engage in transactions that stabilize, maintain, or otherwise
affect the market price of the securities. This may include over-allotments or short sales of the securities, which involves the
sale by persons participating in the offering of more securities than have been sold to them by us. In those circumstances, such
persons would cover such over-allotments or short positions by purchasing in the open market or by exercising the over-allotment
option granted to those persons. In addition, those persons may stabilize or maintain the price of the securities by bidding for
or purchasing securities in the open market or by imposing penalty bids, whereby selling concessions allowed to underwriters or
dealers participating in any such offering may be reclaimed if securities sold by them are repurchased in connection with stabilization
transactions. The effect of these transactions may be to stabilize or maintain the market price of the securities at a level above
that which might otherwise prevail in the open market. Such transactions, if commenced, may be discontinued at any time. We make
no representation or prediction as to the direction or magnitude of any effect that the transactions described above, if implemented,
may have on the price of our securities.</P>
