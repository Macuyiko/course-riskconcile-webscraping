federal income tax purposes as owning the purchase contract and the applicable ownership interests in the Notes, Treasury portfolio or Treasury securities constituting the Equity Unit, as applicable. You must allocate the purchase price of the
Equity Units between the Notes and the purchase contract in proportion to their respective fair market values, which will establish your initial tax basis in the Notes and the purchase contract. With respect to each Corporate Unit purchased in the
offering, we will report the initial fair market value (as of the issue date) of each undivided interest in each note as $50 and the initial fair market value (as of the issue date) of the purchase contract as $0. This position generally will be
binding on each beneficial owner of Equity Units but not on the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”). </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Under the indenture governing
the Notes, we and each holder of the Notes agree, for U.S. federal, state and local income tax purposes, to treat the Notes as indebtedness that is subject to the Treasury regulations governing contingent payment debt obligations in the manner
described below under “Certain United States Federal Income and Estate Tax Consequences.” As discussed more fully below, the effect of these Treasury regulations will be (1)&nbsp;to require you, regardless of your usual method of tax
accounting, to use the accrual method with respect to the Notes, (2)&nbsp;to possibly result in the accrual of original issue discount by you in excess of stated interest payments actually received by you and (3)&nbsp;generally to result in ordinary
rather than capital gain treatment of any gain, and to some extent loss, on the sale, exchange or other disposition of a Note. If the Treasury portfolio has replaced the Notes as a component of the Corporate Units as a result of a successful
optional remarketing, an owner of Corporate Units will generally be required to include in gross income its allocable share of original issue discount </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The net proceeds from the sale of the Equity Units will be allocated between the purchase contracts and the Notes in proportion to their
respective fair market values at the time of issuance. The present value of the contract adjustment payments will be initially charged to shareholders’ equity, with an offsetting credit to liabilities. This liability is accreted over the life
of the purchase contract by interest charges to the income statement based on a constant rate calculation. Subsequent contract adjustment payments reduce this liability. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The purchase contracts are forward transactions in our common stock. Upon settlement of each purchase contract, we will receive $50.00 on the
purchase contract and will issue the requisite number of shares of our common stock. The $50.00 that we receive will be credited to shareholders’<I> </I>equity. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Before the issuance of our common stock upon settlement of the purchase contracts, the purchase contracts will be reflected in our diluted
earnings per share calculations using the treasury stock method. Under this method, the number of shares of our common stock used in calculating diluted earnings per share (based on the settlement formula applied at the end of the reporting period)
is deemed to be increased by the excess, if any, of the number of shares that would be issued upon settlement of the purchase contracts over the number of shares that could be purchased by us in the market (at the average market price during the
period) using the proceeds receivable upon settlement. Consequently, we anticipate that there will be no dilutive effect on our earnings per share except during periods when the average market price of our common stock is above the threshold
appreciation price of $&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Both the Financial Accounting Standards Board and its Emerging
Issues Task Force continue to study the accounting for financial instruments and derivative instruments, including instruments such as the Equity Units. It is possible that our accounting for the purchase contracts and the notes could be affected by
any new accounting rules that might be issued by these groups. </P>

Our subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and have no obligation to pay any amounts on the Notes or to make any funds available for such payment. Therefore, the Notes will be effectively subordinated to all indebtedness and other

will be effectively senior to the Notes. In addition, each subsidiary’s ability to pay dividends to us depends on statutory, regulatory and/or contractual restrictions that may be applicable to such subsidiary. The Subordinated Indenture does
not place any limit on the amount of Senior Indebtedness that we may issue, guarantee or otherwise incur or the amount of liabilities, including debt or preferred stock, that our subsidiaries may issue, guarantee or otherwise incur. We expect that
we and our subsidiaries will incur from time to time additional indebtedness and other liabilities that will be senior to the Notes. At December&nbsp;31, 2018, our Senior Indebtedness, on an unconsolidated basis, totaled approximately
$3.48&nbsp;billion. At December&nbsp;31, 2018, our subsidiaries had approximately $22.1&nbsp;billion of indebtedness outstanding; this amount does not include other liabilities. </P>

Notes are priced after 4:30 p.m. New York time on the optional remarketing date, the third business day following the optional remarketing date) and, in the case of the final remarketing period, the purchase contract settlement date. If a reset
occurs pursuant to a successful optional remarketing, the reset rate or, if the Notes are remarketed as floating-rate Notes, the reset spread will be the interest rate or spread determined by the remarketing agent, in consultation with us, as the
rate or spread the Notes should bear in order for the remarketing proceeds to equal at least 100% of the Treasury portfolio purchase price plus the separate Notes purchase price, if any. If a reset occurs pursuant to a successful final remarketing,
the reset rate or reset spread will be the interest rate or spread determined by the remarketing agent, in consultation with us, as the rate the Notes should bear in order for the remarketing proceeds to equal at least 100% of the principal amount
of the Notes being remarketed. In any case, a reset rate or the applicable index plus the reset spread may be higher or lower than the initial interest rate of the Notes depending on the results of the remarketing and market conditions at that time.
However, in no event will the reset rate or the applicable index plus the reset spread exceed the maximum rate permitted by applicable law. In addition, following a successful remarketing, interest on the Notes remarketed as fixed-rate Notes will be

which the Company would issue a fixed-rate instrument with no contingent payments but with terms and conditions similar to the Notes. If the comparable yield were successfully challenged by the IRS, the redetermined yield could be materially greater

deemed to have agreed in the indenture to be bound by our determination of the comparable yield and projected payment schedule. For United States federal income tax purposes, you must use the comparable yield determined by us and the projected
payments set forth in the projected payment schedule above in determining your interest accruals, and the adjustments thereto, in respect of the Notes. The comparable yield and the projected payment schedule are not provided for any purpose other

would not be considered made pursuant to such a formula if the adjustment were made to compensate you for taxable distributions with respect to our common stock (for example, if we increase the cash dividend on our common stock). Certain of the
possible settlement rate adjustments (including, without limitation, adjustments in respect of taxable dividends to holders of our common stock and as discussed in “Description of the Purchase Contracts — Early Settlement Upon a
Fundamental Change”) may not qualify as being pursuant to a bona fide reasonable adjustment formula. Thus, under certain circumstances, an increase in the fixed settlement rates might give rise to a taxable dividend to you even though you would
not receive any cash related thereto. In addition, in certain situations, you might be treated as receiving a constructive distribution if we fail to adjust the fixed settlement rates. Any deemed distributions will be taxable as a dividend, return
of capital, or capital gain in accordance with the earnings and profits rules described below. It is not clear whether a constructive dividend deemed paid to you would be eligible for the preferential rates of U.S. federal income tax that are
applicable to dividends paid to <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-corporate</FONT> holders. It is also unclear whether corporate holders would be entitled to claim the dividends received deduction with respect to any such constructive dividends.

(DTC’s partnership nominee) or such other name as may be requested by an authorized representative of DTC who will keep a computerized record of its participants (for example, your broker) whose clients have purchased the securities. The
participant will then keep a record of its clients who purchased the securities. Unless it is exchanged in whole or in part for a certificate, a global security may not be transferred, except that DTC, its nominees, and their successors may transfer
a global security as a whole to one another. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Beneficial interests in global securities will be shown on, and transfers of global

Direct Participants’ accounts. This eliminates the need for physical movement of securities certificates. Direct Participants include both U.S. and
<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-U.S.</FONT> securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, clearing corporations, and certain other organizations. DTC is a wholly-owned subsidiary of The Depository Trust&nbsp;&amp; Clearing Corporation
(“DTCC”). DTCC is the holding company for DTC, National Securities Clearing Corporation and Fixed Income Clearing Corporation, all of which are registered clearing agencies. DTCC is owned by the users of its regulated subsidiaries. Access
to the DTC system is also available to others such as both U.S. and <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-U.S.</FONT> securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, and clearing corporations that clear through or maintain a custodial
relationship with a Direct Participant, either directly or indirectly (“Indirect Participants”). The DTC Rules applicable to its Participants are on file with the SEC. More information about DTC can be found at <U>www.dtcc.com</U> . </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Purchases of securities under the DTC system must be made by or through Direct Participants, which will receive a credit for the securities on
DTC’s records. The ownership interest of each actual purchaser of each security (“Beneficial Owner”) is in turn to be recorded on the Direct and Indirect Participants’ records. Beneficial Owners will not receive written
confirmation from DTC of their purchase. Beneficial Owners are, however, expected to receive written confirmations providing details of the transaction, as well as periodic statements of their holdings, from the Direct or Indirect Participant
through which the Beneficial Owner entered into the transaction. Transfers of ownership interests in the securities are to be accomplished by entries made on the books of Direct and Indirect Participants acting on behalf of Beneficial Owners.
Beneficial Owners will not receive certificates representing their ownership interests in securities, except in the event that use of the book-entry system for the securities is discontinued. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">To facilitate subsequent transfers, all securities deposited by Direct Participants with DTC are registered in the name of DTC’s
partnership nominee, Cede&nbsp;&amp; Co., or such other name as may be requested by an authorized representative of DTC. The deposit of securities with DTC and their registration in the name of Cede&nbsp;&amp; Co. or such other DTC nominee do not
effect any change in beneficial ownership. DTC has no knowledge of the actual Beneficial Owners of the securities; DTC’s records reflect only the identity of the Direct Participants to whose accounts such securities are credited, which may or
may not be the Beneficial Owners. The Direct and Indirect Participants will remain responsible for keeping account of their holdings on behalf of their customers. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Conveyance of notices and other communications by DTC to Direct Participants, by Direct Participants to Indirect Participants, and by Direct
Participants and Indirect Participants to Beneficial Owners will be governed by arrangements among them, subject to any statutory or regulatory requirements as may be in effect from time to time. Beneficial Owners of securities may wish to take
certain steps to augment the transmission to them of notices of significant events with respect to the securities, such as redemptions, tenders, defaults, and proposed amendments to the securities documents. For example, Beneficial Owners of
securities may wish to ascertain that the nominee holding the securities for their benefit has agreed to obtain and transmit notices to Beneficial Owners. In the alternative, Beneficial Owners may wish to provide their names and addresses to the
registrar and request that copies of notices be provided directly to them. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Neither DTC nor Cede&nbsp;&amp; Co. (nor any other DTC nominee) will consent or vote with respect to the securities unless authorized by a
Direct Participant in accordance with DTC’s MMI Procedures. Under its usual procedures, DTC mails an Omnibus Proxy to us as soon as possible after the record date. The Omnibus Proxy assigns Cede&nbsp;&amp; Co.’s consenting or voting rights
to those Direct Participants to whose accounts the securities are credited on the record date (identified in a listing attached to the Omnibus Proxy). </P>

DTC. DTC’s practice is to credit Direct Participants’ accounts upon DTC’s receipt of funds and corresponding detail information from us or the Trustee on the payable date in accordance with their respective holdings shown on
DTC’s records. Payments by Participants to Beneficial Owners will be governed by standing instructions and customary practices, as is the case with securities held for the accounts of customers in bearer form or registered in “street
name”, and will be the responsibility of such Participant and not of DTC, the Trustee or us, subject to any statutory or regulatory requirements as may be in effect from time to time. Payment of redemption proceeds and distributions to
Cede&nbsp;&amp; Co. (or such other nominee as may be requested by an authorized representative of DTC) is our responsibility, disbursement of such payments to Direct Participants will be the responsibility of DTC, and disbursement of such payments
to the Beneficial Owners will be the responsibility of Direct and Indirect Participants. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">A Beneficial Owner shall give notice to elect to
have its securities purchased or tendered, through its Participant, to the Tender/Remarketing Agent, and shall effect delivery of such securities by causing the Direct Participant to transfer the Participant’s interest in the securities, on
DTC’s records, to the Tender/Remarketing Agent. The requirement for physical delivery of the securities in connection with an optional tender or a mandatory purchase will be deemed satisfied when the ownership rights in the securities are
transferred by Direct Participants on DTC’s records and followed by a book-entry credit of tendered securities to the Tender/Remarketing Agent’s DTC account. </P>
