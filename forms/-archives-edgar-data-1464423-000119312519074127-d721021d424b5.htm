the information contained in or incorporated by reference into this prospectus supplement differs or varies from the information contained in or incorporated by reference into the accompanying prospectus, the information contained in or incorporated

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">This prospectus supplement and the accompanying prospectus, as well as the documents we incorporate herein and therein by reference, contain
certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, which are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements are generally identifiable by use of forward-looking
terminology such as “may,” “will,” “should,” “potential,” “intend,” “expect,” “seek,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “approximately,” “believe,”
“could,” “project,” “predict,” “continue,” “plan” or other similar words or expressions. Forward-looking statements are based on certain assumptions, discuss future expectations, describe future
plans and strategies, contain financial and operating projections or state other forward-looking information. Examples of forward-looking statements include: (i)&nbsp;projections of our revenues, income, earnings per share, capital structure or
other financial items; (ii)&nbsp;descriptions of our plans or objectives for future operations, products or services; (iii)&nbsp;forecasts of our future economic performance, interest rates, profit margins and our share of future markets; and
(iv)&nbsp;descriptions of assumptions underlying or relating to any of the foregoing expectations regarding the timing of generating any revenues. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our ability to predict results or the actual effect of future events, actions, plans or strategies is inherently uncertain. Although we
believe that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, our actual results and performance could differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. There are a number of
factors, many of which are beyond our control, that could cause actual results to differ significantly from our expectations. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">You should
not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statement, each of which speaks only as of the date on which it is made. We expressly state that we have no current intention to update any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new
information, future events or otherwise, unless required by law. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Factors that could cause our actual results and performance to differ

by PLS. We have also historically invested in distressed mortgage assets (mortgage loans and real estate acquired in settlement of mortgage loans) as well as other credit sensitive assets, including loans that finance multifamily and other
commercial real estate, which are no longer our primary focus for new investments. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We are externally managed by PCM, an <FONT

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, or ERISA, and Section&nbsp;4975 of the Code, prohibit certain transactions,
or prohibited transactions, involving the assets of (i)&nbsp;an employee benefit plan that is subject to the prohibited transaction provisions of Title I of ERISA or Section&nbsp;4975 of the Code (including individual retirement accounts, Keogh
plans and other plans described in Section&nbsp;4975(e)(1) of the Code) and (ii)&nbsp;entities whose underlying assets are considered to include “plan assets” of any such plan, account or arrangement (each of the foregoing described in
clauses (i)&nbsp;and (ii) being referred to herein as a “Plan”) and certain persons who are “parties in interest” (within the meaning of ERISA) or “disqualified persons” (within the meaning of the Code) with respect to
the Plan. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We, certain of the agents and certain of our respective affiliates may be considered a “party in interest” or a
“disqualified person” with respect to many Plans and, accordingly, prohibited transactions may arise if any common shares are acquired by or on behalf of a Plan unless the common shares are acquired pursuant to an available exemption, of
which there are many. In this regard, the U.S. Department of Labor, or DOL, has issued prohibited transaction class exemptions that may apply to the acquisition of common shares. These exemptions include transactions effected on behalf of a Plan by
a “qualified professional asset manager” (prohibited transaction exemption <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">84-14)</FONT> or an <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">“in-house</FONT> asset manager” (prohibited transaction exemption <FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">96-23),</FONT> transactions involving insurance company general accounts (prohibited transaction exemption <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">95-60),</FONT> transactions involving insurance company pooled separate accounts
(prohibited transaction exemption <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">90-1),</FONT> and transactions involving bank collective investment funds (prohibited transaction exemption <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">91-38).</FONT> In addition,
Section&nbsp;408(b)(17) of ERISA and Section&nbsp;4975(d)(20) of the Code provide relief from the prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA and Section&nbsp;4975 of the Code for certain transactions, provided that neither the issuer of the
securities nor any of its affiliates (directly or indirectly) has or exercises any discretionary authority or control or renders any investment advice with respect to the assets of any Plan involved in the transaction and provided further that the
Plan receives no less and pays no more than “adequate consideration” (within the meaning of Section&nbsp;408(b)(17) of ERISA and Section&nbsp;4975(f)(10) of the Code). There can be no assurance that all of the conditions of any such
exemptions will be satisfied. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Governmental plans, certain church plans and <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-U.S.</FONT> plans may not
be subject to the prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA or the Code but may be subject to similar laws (“Similar Laws”). Fiduciaries of any such plans should consult with counsel before acquisition or ownership of common shares. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Because of the foregoing, the person making the decision on behalf of a Plan or a governmental, church or foreign plan will be deemed, by
purchasing the common shares, to represent on behalf of itself and the plan that the purchase of common shares will not result in a <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-exempt</FONT> prohibited transaction under ERISA or Section&nbsp;4975 of the
Code or any applicable Similar Law. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The foregoing discussion is general in nature and is not intended to be all inclusive. Due to the
complexity of these rules and the penalties that may be imposed upon persons involved in <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-exempt</FONT> prohibited transactions, it is particularly important that fiduciaries, or other persons considering the
acquisition or ownership of common shares on behalf of, or with the assets of, any Plan, consult with their counsel regarding the potential applicability of ERISA, Section&nbsp;4975 of the Code and any Similar Laws to such investment and whether an
exemption would be applicable to the acquisition of common shares. </P>

other than on an exchange or through an electronic communications network. In addition, our common shares may be offered and sold by such other methods, including block transactions and privately negotiated transactions, as we and the agents may
agree. Sales of our common shares, if any, will be made through only one agent on any given day. As sales agents, none of the agents will engage in any transactions intended to stabilize the price of our common shares. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We are a specialty finance company that invests primarily in residential mortgage loans and mortgage-related assets. Our objective is to
provide attractive risk-adjusted returns to our investors over the long-term, primarily through dividends and secondarily through capital appreciation. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our investment focus is on mortgage-related assets that we create through our correspondent production activities, including MSRs and credit
risk transfer agreements, or CRT Agreements. We have pursued this objective largely by acquiring, pooling and selling newly originated prime credit quality residential mortgage loans (“correspondent production”) and retaining the MSRs
relating to such mortgage loans and investing in CRT Agreements relating to mortgage loan sales. We also invest in mortgage-backed securities, or MBS, excess servicing spread, or ESS, on MSRs acquired by PennyMac Loan Services, LLC, or PLS, and
commercial real estate loans that finance multifamily and other commercial real estate. We have also historically invested in distressed mortgage assets (mortgage loans and real estate acquired in settlement of mortgage loans), which are no longer
our primary focus for new investments. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We are externally managed by our affiliate, PNMAC Capital Management, LLC, or PCM, an investment
adviser that specializes in, and focuses on, residential mortgage loans. Most of our mortgage loan portfolio is serviced on our behalf primarily by PLS. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We conduct substantially all of our operations, and make substantially all of our investments, through our operating partnership and its

of trust regarding the restrictions on ownership and transfer of our shares, holders of our common shares are entitled to receive distributions on such common shares out of assets legally available therefor if, as and when authorized by our board of

declaration of trust regarding the restrictions on ownership and transfer of shares of beneficial interest, the preferences, conversion and other rights, voting powers, restrictions, limitations as to dividends and other distributions,
qualifications and terms and conditions of redemption for each class or series. Therefore, our board of trustees could authorize the issuance of a class or series of shares that has priority over our common shares as to voting rights, dividends or

classified or reclassified shares of beneficial interest provides us with increased flexibility in structuring possible future financings and acquisitions and in meeting other needs that might arise. The additional classes or series of shares will
be available for issuance without further action by our common shareholders, unless such action is required by applicable law or the rules of any stock exchange or automated quotation system on which our securities may be listed or traded. Although
our board of trustees does not intend to do so, it could authorize us to issue a class or series of shares that could, depending upon the terms of the particular class or series, delay, defer or prevent a change in control or other transaction that

the “share ownership limits.” </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The constructive ownership rules under the Internal Revenue Code are complex and may cause shares

restrictive, of our outstanding common shares or 9.8% by vote or value, whichever is more restrictive, of our outstanding shares of beneficial interest (or the acquisition of an interest in an entity that owns, actually or constructively, our shares
of beneficial interest), could, nevertheless, cause the acquirer, or another individual or entity, to own constructively in excess of 9.8% by vote or value, whichever is more restrictive, of our outstanding common shares or 9.8% by vote or value,
whichever is more restrictive, of our outstanding shares of beneficial interest and thereby violate the applicable share ownership limit. </P>

then or in the future result in our being “closely held” under Section&nbsp;856(h) of the Internal Revenue Code (without regard to whether the shareholder’s interest is held during the last half of a taxable year) or otherwise cause
us to fail to qualify as a REIT or result in our shares of beneficial interest being beneficially owned by fewer than 100 persons (determined without reference to any rules of attribution). As a condition of its exemption or creation of an excepted
holder limit, our board of trustees may, but is not required to, require an opinion of counsel or Internal Revenue Service, or IRS, ruling satisfactory to our board of trustees in order to determine or ensure our status as a REIT and may impose any
other conditions or restrictions on such a waiver or excepted holder limit as it deems appropriate. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In connection with granting an
exemption from the share ownership limits, establishing an excepted holder limit or at any other time, our board of trustees may from time to time increase or decrease one or both of the share ownership limits for all other persons and entities;
provided, however, that any decrease in a share ownership limit will not be effective for any person whose percentage of ownership of our shares is in excess of such decreased limit until the person’s percentage of ownership of our shares
equals or falls below the decreased limit (other than a decrease as a result of a retroactive change in existing law, in which case the decrease will be effective immediately), but any further acquisition of our shares in excess of such
person’s percentage of ownership of our shares will be in violation of the applicable limits; and provided, further, that the share ownership limits may not be increased if, after giving effect to such increase, five or fewer individuals could
beneficially own or constructively own in the aggregate more than 49.9% in value of the shares then outstanding. Prior to the modification of the share ownership limits, our board of trustees may, but is not required to, require such opinions of
counsel, affidavits, undertakings or agreements as it may deem necessary or advisable in order to determine or ensure our qualification as a REIT. </P>

purport to be complete and is subject to and qualified in its entirety by reference to Maryland law and our declaration of trust and bylaws. We have incorporated by reference our declaration of trust and bylaws as exhibits to the registration
statement of which this prospectus is a part. </I></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Classification of Board of Trustees </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Pursuant to our declaration of trust, our board of trustees is divided into three classes of trustees. Trustees of each class are elected for
three-year terms upon the expiration of their current terms, and every year one class of our trustees is elected by our shareholders. We believe that classification of our board of trustees helps to assure the continuity and stability of our
business strategies and policies as determined by our board of trustees. Holders of our common shares do not have the right to cumulative voting in the election of trustees. Consequently, at each annual meeting of shareholders, the shareholders
entitled to cast a majority of the votes entitled to be cast in the election of trustees are able to elect all of the successors of the class of trustees whose terms expire at the meeting. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The classified board provision in our declaration of trust could have the effect of making the replacement of incumbent trustees more time
consuming and difficult. Two separate meetings of shareholders, instead of one, will generally be required to effect a change in a majority of our trustees. Thus, the classified board provision could increase the likelihood that incumbent trustees
will retain their positions. The staggered terms of trustees could delay, defer or prevent a change of control or other transaction that might involve a premium price for our common shares or otherwise be in the best interests of our shareholders.
</P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Number of Trustees; Vacancies </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our
declaration of trust and bylaws provide that the number of our trustees may be established by our board of trustees but may not be more than 15. Our declaration of trust and bylaws currently provide that any vacancy may be filled only by a majority
of the remaining trustees. Pursuant to our declaration of trust, we have elected to be subject to the provision of Subtitle 8 of Title&nbsp;3 of the Maryland General Corporation Law, or the MGCL, regarding the filling of vacancies on our board of
trustees. Accordingly, except as may be provided by our board of trustees in setting the terms of any class or series of shares, any and all vacancies on our board of trustees may be filled only by the affirmative vote of a majority of the remaining
trustees in office, even if the remaining trustees do not constitute a quorum, and any individual elected to fill such vacancy will serve for the remainder of the full term of the class in which the vacancy occurred and until a successor is duly
elected and qualifies. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Each of our trustees is elected by our shareholders to serve for the applicable term of the class to which he or
she was elected, pursuant to our classified board provisions, and until his or her successor is duly elected and qualifies. A majority of all votes cast “for” or “against,” or affirmatively withheld, in the election of trustees
at a meeting of shareholders at which a quorum is present is sufficient to elect a trustee in an uncontested election. A plurality of all votes cast is sufficient to elect a trustee in a contested election. In addition, our corporate governance
guidelines require any trustee nominee who fails to receive a majority vote in an uncontested election must promptly tender his or her resignation to our board of trustees. The presence in person or by proxy of shareholders entitled to cast a
majority of all the votes entitled to be cast at a meeting constitutes a quorum. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Removal of Trustees </B></P>

other conditions, the real estate investment trust’s shareholders receive a minimum price (as defined in the MGCL) for their shares and the consideration is received in cash or in the same form as previously paid by the interested shareholder
for its shares. Under the MGCL, a person is not an “interested shareholder” if the board of trustees approved in advance the transaction by which the person otherwise would have become an interested shareholder. A board of trustees may

exempted business combinations between us and any other person from these provisions of the MGCL, provided that the business combination is first approved by our board of trustees and, consequently, the five year prohibition and the supermajority
vote requirements will not apply to such business combinations. As a result, any person approved by our board of trustees will be able to enter into business combinations with us that may not be in the best interests of our shareholders without
compliance by us with the supermajority vote requirements and other provisions of the statute. This resolution, however, may be altered or repealed in whole or in part at any time. If this resolution is repealed, or our board of trustees does not
otherwise approve a business combination, the statute may discourage others from trying to acquire control of us and increase the difficulty of consummating any offer. </P>

deliberate dishonesty that is established by a final judgment and is material to the cause of action. Our declaration of trust contains a provision that eliminates the liability of our trustees and officers to the maximum extent permitted by

which such person may incur by reason of his or her service in such capacity or capacities, and to pay or reimburse his or her reasonable expenses in advance of final disposition of such a proceeding. Our declaration of trust and bylaws also permit
us to indemnify and advance expenses to any person who served any predecessor of ours in any of the capacities described above and to any employee or agent of ours or a predecessor of ours. We also have entered into indemnification agreements with
our trustees and executive officers that address similar matters. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Maryland law permits a Maryland real estate investment trust to
indemnify and advance expenses to its trustees, officers, employees and agents to the same extent as&nbsp;is permitted for directors and officers of Maryland corporations under the MGCL. The MGCL permits a Maryland corporation to indemnify its
present and former directors and officers, among others, against judgments, penalties, fines, settlements and reasonable expenses actually incurred by them in connection with any proceeding to which they may be made or threatened to be made a party
by reason of their service in those or other capacities unless it is established that (1)&nbsp;the act or omission of the director or officer was material to the matter giving rise to the proceeding and (A)&nbsp;was committed in bad faith or
(B)&nbsp;was the result of active and deliberate dishonesty, (2)&nbsp;the director or officer actually received an improper personal benefit in money, property or services or (3)&nbsp;in the case of any criminal proceeding, the director or officer
had reasonable cause to believe that the act or omission was unlawful. Under the MGCL, a Maryland corporation also may not indemnify for an adverse judgment in a suit by or on behalf of the corporation in which the director or officer was adjudged
liable to the corporation or for a judgment of liability on the basis that a personal benefit was improperly received. A court may order indemnification if it determines that the director or officer is fairly and reasonably entitled to
indemnification even though the director or officer did not meet the prescribed standard of conduct. However, indemnification for an adverse judgment in a suit by or on behalf of the corporation or for a judgment of liability on the basis that a
personal benefit was improperly received is limited to expenses. In addition, the MGCL permits a Maryland corporation to advance reasonable expenses to a director or officer upon the corporation’s receipt of (1)&nbsp;a written affirmation by
the director or officer of his or her good faith belief that he or she has met the standard of conduct necessary for indemnification by the corporation and (2)&nbsp;a written undertaking by him or her or on his or her behalf to repay the amount paid

subsidiaries or other lower-tier entities, except as otherwise indicated. This summary is based upon the Internal Revenue Code, the regulations promulgated by the U.S.&nbsp;Treasury, rulings and other administrative pronouncements issued by the IRS,
and judicial decisions, all as currently in effect, and all of which are subject to differing interpretations or to change, possibly with retroactive effect. In addition, this summary does not discuss how the scheduled sunsetting of certain
provisions of H.R. 1, commonly known as the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or the Tax Act, which was enacted on December&nbsp;22, 2017, may affect us or our shareholders. No assurance can be given that the IRS would not assert, or that a court would
not sustain, a position contrary to any of the tax consequences described below. No advance ruling has been or will be sought from the IRS regarding any matter discussed in this prospectus. This summary is also based upon the assumption that our
operation and the operation of our subsidiaries and affiliated entities will continue to be in accordance with our declaration of trust or our subsidiaries’ respective organizational documents, as the case may be. This summary is for general
information only, and does not purport to discuss all aspects of U.S.&nbsp;federal income taxation that may be important to a particular investor in light of its investment or tax circumstances, or to investors subject to special tax rules, such as:

and interpretations of complex provisions of U.S.&nbsp;federal income tax law for which no clear precedent or authority may be available. In addition, the tax consequences to any particular shareholder holding our shares of beneficial interest will
depend on the shareholder’s particular tax circumstances. For example, a shareholder that is a partnership or trust which has issued an equity interest to certain types of <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">tax-exempt</FONT> organizations may be
subject to a special entity level tax if we make distributions attributable to “excess inclusion income.” See “—Taxation of PennyMac Mortgage Investment Trust—Taxable Mortgage Pools and Excess Inclusion Income” below. A
similar tax may be payable by persons who hold our shares of beneficial interest as nominee on behalf of such a <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">tax-exempt</FONT> organization. You are urged to consult your tax advisor regarding the

will enable us to continue to meet the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code. It must be emphasized that the opinion of Sidley Austin LLP is based on various assumptions relating to our organization
and operation and is conditioned upon fact-based representations and covenants made by our management regarding our organization, assets, income and the past, present and future conduct of our business operations. While we intend to operate so that
we will qualify as a REIT, given the highly complex nature of the rules governing REITs, the ongoing importance of factual determinations, and the possibility of future changes in our circumstances, no assurance can be given by Sidley Austin LLP or
us that we will so qualify for any particular year. The opinion will be expressed as of the date issued. Sidley Austin LLP will have no obligation to advise us or the holders of our shares of beneficial interest of any subsequent change in the
matters stated, represented or assumed, or of any subsequent change in the applicable law. You should be aware that opinions of counsel are not binding on the IRS, and no assurance can be given that the IRS will not challenge the conclusions set

as a REIT also requires that we satisfy certain asset tests, some of which depend upon the fair market values of assets directly or indirectly owned by us. Such values may not be susceptible to a precise determination. Accordingly, no assurance can

U.S.&nbsp;federal corporate income tax on our taxable income that is currently distributed to our shareholders. This treatment substantially eliminates the “double taxation” at the corporate and shareholder levels that generally results
from investment in a corporation. Rather, income generated by a REIT generally is taxed only at the shareholder level upon a distribution of dividends by the REIT. </P>

maximum of 20% (the same as the current rate for long-term capital gains), not including the 3.8% Medicare tax described below. With certain exceptions, however, dividends received by our shareholders from us or from other entities that are taxed as
REITs are generally not eligible for such 20% rate, and will be taxed at rates applicable to ordinary income. Such shareholders, however, would generally be subject to tax at such preferred rates on dividends paid by us to the extent that the
dividends are attributable to dividends paid by one or more TRSs. In addition, the Tax Act generally may allow domestic shareholders to deduct from their taxable income <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">one-fifth</FONT> of the REIT dividends payable
to them that are not treated as capital gains dividends or as qualified dividend income, or Qualified REIT Dividends, for taxable years beginning after December&nbsp;31, 2017 and before January&nbsp;1, 2026. See “—Taxation of

in which the record holders are to disclose the actual owners of the shares of beneficial interest (i.e., the persons required to include the dividends paid by us in their gross income). A list of those persons failing or refusing to comply with
this demand must be maintained as part of our records. Failure by us to comply with these record keeping requirements could subject us to monetary penalties. A shareholder that fails or refuses to comply with the demand is required by Treasury

purposes of the asset and gross income tests applicable to REITs, as described below. A REIT’s proportionate share of a partnership’s assets and income is based on the REIT’s capital interest in the partnership (except that for
purposes of the 10% value test, our proportionate share of the partnership’s assets is based on our proportionate interest in the equity and certain debt securities issued by the partnership). In addition, the assets and gross income of the
partnership are deemed to retain the same character in the hands of the REIT. Thus, our proportionate share of the assets and items of income of our operating partnership and any other subsidiary partnerships will be treated as assets and items of

credit of the subsidiary are treated as assets, liabilities and items of income, deduction and credit of the REIT itself, including for purposes of the gross income and asset tests applicable to
REITs, as summarized below. A qualified REIT subsidiary is any corporation, other than a TRS, as described below, that is wholly-owned by a REIT, or by other disregarded subsidiaries, or by a combination of the two. Other entities that are
wholly-owned by a REIT, including single member limited liability companies that have not elected to be taxed as corporations for U.S.&nbsp;federal income tax purposes, are also generally disregarded as separate entities for U.S. federal income tax
purposes, including for purposes of the REIT income and asset tests. Disregarded subsidiaries, along with any partnerships in which we hold an equity interest, are sometimes referred to herein as “pass through subsidiaries.” </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In the event that a disregarded subsidiary of ours ceases to be wholly-owned—for example, if any equity interest in the subsidiary is
acquired by a person other than us or another disregarded subsidiary of ours—or is classified as a TRS, the subsidiary’s separate existence would no longer be disregarded for U.S.&nbsp;federal income tax purposes. Instead, it would have
multiple owners and would be treated as either a partnership or a taxable corporation. Such an event could, depending on the circumstances, adversely affect our ability to satisfy the various asset and gross income requirements applicable to REITs,
including the requirement that REITs generally may not own, directly or indirectly, more than 10% of the securities of another corporation unless it is a TRS or a qualified REIT subsidiary. See “—Asset Tests” and “—Income

held as inventory or primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business will be treated as income from a prohibited transaction that is subject to a 100% tax. Under existing law, whether property is held as inventory or primarily for
sale to customers in the ordinary course of a trade or business depends upon all of the facts and circumstances of the particular transaction. We intend that our operating partnership will conduct its operations so that no asset owned by it or its
pass-through subsidiaries will be considered to be held for sale to customers, and that a sale of any such asset will not be in the ordinary course of business. In order to avoid the prohibited transactions tax, we intend to engage in certain sales
of loans through a TRS, which will be subject to corporate income tax on any income or gain derived from the loans it holds and sells, and not at the REIT level. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Taxable REIT Subsidiaries. </I>A REIT, in general, may jointly elect with subsidiary corporations, whether or not wholly-owned, to treat
the subsidiary corporation as a TRS. A REIT generally may not own more than 10% of the securities of a taxable corporation, as measured by voting power or value, unless the corporation elects to be a TRS. The separate existence of a TRS or other
taxable corporation, unlike a disregarded subsidiary as discussed above, is not ignored for U.S.&nbsp;federal income tax purposes. Accordingly, such a TRS would generally be subject to corporate income tax on its earnings, which may reduce the cash
flow generated by us and our subsidiaries in the aggregate, and our ability to make distributions to our shareholders. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">A parent REIT is
not treated as holding the assets of a taxable subsidiary corporation or as receiving any income that the subsidiary earns. Rather, the stock issued by the subsidiary is an asset in the hands of the parent REIT, and the REIT recognizes as income the
dividends, if any, that it receives from the subsidiary. This treatment can affect the income and asset test calculations that apply to the parent REIT, as described below. Because a parent REIT does not include the assets and income of such
subsidiary corporations in determining the parent’s compliance with the REIT requirements, such entities may be used by the parent REIT to indirectly undertake activities that the REIT rules might otherwise preclude it from doing directly or
through pass through subsidiaries (for example, activities that give rise to certain categories of income such as management or market-rate servicing fees). </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Certain restrictions imposed on TRSs are intended to ensure that such entities will be subject to appropriate levels of U.S.&nbsp;federal

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We intend to hold a significant amount of assets in one or more TRSs, subject to the limitation that securities in TRSs may not represent more
than 20% of our assets. In general, we intend that loans that we originate or buy with an intention of selling (as in the case of our correspondent lending business) in a manner that might expose us to a 100% tax on “prohibited
transactions” will be originated or sold by a TRS. The TRS through which any such sales are made may be treated as a dealer for U.S.&nbsp;federal income tax purposes. As a dealer, the TRS would in general mark all the loans it holds on the last
day of each taxable year to their market value, and would recognize ordinary income or loss on such loans with respect to such taxable year as if they had been sold for that value on that day. In addition, such TRS may further elect to be subject to
the <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">mark-to-market</FONT></FONT> regime described above in the event that the TRS is properly classified as a “trader” as opposed to a “dealer” for
U.S.&nbsp;federal income tax purposes. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The same TRS may also be the entity through which most loan modifications are made. See
“—Cash/Income Differences/Phantom Income”. In this circumstance, modified loans held by that TRS would be subject to the same mark to market regime as the other assets of the TRS, if applicable, in determining the taxable income of
the TRS each year. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We also expect that some or all of the real property that we may acquire by foreclosure or similar process will be

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We engage in various lending, purchase and financing transactions involving our TRS that result in us holding gross assets that we treat as
“real estate assets” that give rise to gross income that is “interest on obligations secured by interests in real property” for purposes of the gross asset and gross income tests that we must satisfy to qualify as a REIT. We do
so based on our interpretations of certain published revenue rulings and on the rationale used in private letter rulings issued to other taxpayers (and on which we accordingly may not rely). Such transactions also ordinarily involve leverage in the
form of loans obtained by us or our TRS from third-party financing sources that have recourse both to us and to our TRS for the repayment of those loans. If the IRS were to challenge our treatment of these transactions and holdings, it could
adversely affect our qualification as a REIT. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Cash/Income Differences/Phantom Income. </I>Due to the nature of the assets in which we
will invest, we may be required to recognize taxable income from those assets in advance of our receipt of cash flow on or proceeds from disposition of such assets, and may be required to report taxable income in early periods that exceeds the
economic income ultimately realized on such assets. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">It is expected that we may acquire debt instruments in the secondary market for less
than their face amount. The discount at which such debt instruments are acquired may reflect doubts about their ultimate collectability rather than current market interest rates. The amount of such discount will nevertheless generally be treated as
“market discount” for U.S.&nbsp;federal income tax purposes. Market discount on a debt instrument accrues on the basis of the constant yield to maturity of the debt instrument, and is reported as income when, and to the extent that, any
payment of principal of the debt instrument is made. Payments on residential mortgage loans are ordinarily made monthly, and consequently accrued market discount may have to be included in income each month as if the debt instrument were assured of
ultimately being collected in full. If that turned out not to be the case, and we eventually collected less on the debt instrument than the amount we paid for it plus the market discount we had previously reported as income, there would be a bad
debt deduction available to us at that time. Nevertheless, our (and our shareholders’) ability to benefit from that bad debt deduction would depend on our having taxable income in that later taxable year. REITs may not carry back net operating
losses, so this possible “income early, losses later” phenomenon could adversely affect us and our shareholders if it were persistent and in significant amounts. </P>

payments are received on such debt instrument. As in the case of the market discount discussed in the preceding paragraph, the constant yield in question will be determined and income will be accrued based on the assumption that all future payments

recognize income to the extent the principal amount of the modified debt exceeds our adjusted tax basis in the unmodified debt, and would hold the modified loan with a cost basis equal to its principal amount for U.S.&nbsp;federal tax purposes. To
the extent that such modifications are made with respect to a debt instrument held by our TRS treated as a dealer as described in the immediately preceding section of this discussion, such a TRS would be required at the end of each taxable year,
including the taxable year in which any such modification were made, to mark the modified debt instrument to its fair market value as if the debt instrument were sold. In that case, the TRS would recognize a loss at the end of the taxable year in
which the modification were made to the extent the fair market value of such debt instrument were less than its principal amount after the modification. </P>

the event a borrower with respect to a particular debt instrument acquired by us encounters financial difficulty rendering it unable to pay stated interest as due, we may nonetheless be required to continue to recognize the unpaid interest as
taxable income. Similarly, we may be required to accrue interest income with respect to subordinate MBS at the stated rate regardless of whether corresponding cash payments are received. </P>

interest income derived from mortgage loans collateralized by real property (including certain types of MBS), “rents from real property,” dividends received from other REITs, and gains from the sale of real estate assets, as well as

apportioned between the real property and the other collateral, and our income from the arrangement will qualify for purposes of the 75% income test only to the extent that the interest is allocable to the real property. Even if a loan is not
collateralized by real property, or is undercollateralized, the income that it generates may nonetheless qualify for purposes of the 95% income test. In Revenue Procedure <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">2011-16,</FONT> as modified by Revenue

other securities constitute, in the aggregate, 1.0% or less of the total value of that issuer’s outstanding securities. In addition to straight debt, the Internal Revenue Code provides that certain other securities will not violate the 10%

timely file our tax return for the year and if paid with or before the first regular dividend payment after such declaration. For distributions to be counted for this purpose, and to give rise to a tax deduction by us, they must not be
“preferential dividends” unless we are a Publicly Offered REIT. A dividend is not a preferential dividend if it is pro&nbsp;rata among all outstanding shares of beneficial interest within a particular class, and is in accordance with the
preferences among different classes of shares of beneficial interest as set forth in the REIT’s organizational documents. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">To the
extent that we distribute at least 90%, but less than 100%, of our “REIT taxable income,” as adjusted, we will be subject to tax at ordinary corporate tax rates on the retained portion. We may elect to retain, rather than distribute, our
net long-term capital gains and pay tax on such gains. In this case, we could elect to have our shareholders include their proportionate share of such undistributed long-term capital gains in income, and to receive a corresponding credit for their
share of the tax paid by us. Shareholders would then increase the adjusted basis of their shares of beneficial interest by the difference between the designated amounts of capital gains from us that they include in their taxable income, and the tax
paid on their behalf by us with respect to that income. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">To the extent that a REIT has available net operating losses carried forward from
prior tax years, such losses may reduce the amount of distributions that it must make in order to comply with the REIT distribution requirements. Any distributions made with respect to such tax years into which net operating losses have been carried
forward from prior tax years will nevertheless be taxable as dividends to the extent of current earnings or profits for such tax year. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">If
we should fail to distribute during each calendar year at least the sum of (a)&nbsp;85% of our REIT ordinary income for such year, (b)&nbsp;95% of our REIT capital gain net income for such year, and (c)&nbsp;any undistributed taxable income from
prior periods, we would be subject to a <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-deductible</FONT> 4% excise tax on the excess of such required distribution over the sum of (x)&nbsp;the amounts actually distributed and (y)&nbsp;the amounts of income
retained on which we have paid corporate income tax. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">It is possible that we, from time to time, may not have sufficient cash to meet the
distribution requirements due to timing differences between (a)&nbsp;the actual receipt of cash, including receipt of distributions from our subsidiaries, and (b)&nbsp;the inclusion of items in income by us for U.S.&nbsp;federal income tax purposes.
This may be especially an issue with respect to our investments in distressed or modified debt instruments. See “—Effect of Subsidiary Entities—Cash/Income Differences/Phantom Income.” In the event that such timing differences
occur, in order to meet the distribution requirements, it might be necessary to arrange for short term, or possibly long term, borrowings, or to make distributions in the form of our shares of beneficial interest or taxable in kind distributions of
property. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We may be able to rectify a failure to meet the distribution requirements for a year by paying “deficiency dividends”
to shareholders in a later year, which may be included in our deduction for dividends paid for the earlier year. In this case, we may be able to avoid losing our REIT qualification or being taxed on amounts distributed as deficiency dividends.
However, we will be required to pay interest and a penalty based on the amount of any deduction taken for deficiency dividends. </P>

disqualification if our failure is due to reasonable cause and not to willful neglect and we pay a penalty of $50,000 for each such failure. In addition, there are relief provisions for a failure of the gross income tests and asset tests, as
described above under “—Income Tests” and “—Asset Tests.” </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">If we failed to qualify for taxation as a REIT in
any taxable year, and the relief provisions described above did not apply, we would be subject to tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates. Distributions to shareholders in any year in which we were not a REIT would not be deductible by
us, nor would they be required to be made. In this situation, to the extent of current and accumulated earnings and profits, distributions to domestic shareholders that are individuals, trusts and estates would generally be taxable at capital gains
rates and, subject to limitations of the Internal Revenue Code, corporate distributees may be eligible for the dividends received deduction. Unless we were entitled to relief under specific statutory provisions, we would also be disqualified from <FONT

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Net income derived by a REIT from a prohibited transaction is subject to a 100% tax. Any foreign currency gain (as defined in
Section&nbsp;988(b)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code) and any foreign currency loss (as defined in Section&nbsp;988(b)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code) in connection with a prohibited transaction will be taken into account in determining the amount
of income subject to the 100% tax. The term “prohibited transaction” generally includes a sale or other disposition of property (other than foreclosure property, as discussed below) that is held primarily for sale to customers in the
ordinary course of a trade or business. We intend to conduct our operations so that no asset owned by us or our pass through subsidiaries will be held for sale to customers, and that a sale of any such asset will not be in the ordinary course of our
business. Whether property is held “primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of a trade or business” depends, however, on the particular facts and circumstances. No assurance can be given that any property sold by us will not
be treated as property held for sale to customers, or that we can comply with certain safe harbor provisions of the Internal Revenue Code that would prevent such treatment. The 100% tax does not apply to gains from the sale of property that is held
through a TRS or other taxable corporation, although such income will be subject to tax in the hands of the corporation at regular corporate rates. Therefore, in order to avoid the prohibited transactions tax, we intend to engage in certain sales of
loans and other activities that could potentially give rise to income from a prohibited transaction through a TRS and not at the REIT level. </P>

property is real property and any personal property incident to such real property (i)&nbsp;that is acquired by a REIT as the result of the REIT having bid on the property at foreclosure, or having otherwise reduced the property to ownership or

acquired by the REIT at a time when default was not imminent or anticipated, and (iii)&nbsp;for which such REIT makes a proper election to treat the property as foreclosure property. REITs generally are subject to tax at the maximum corporate rate
(currently 21%) on any net income from foreclosure property, including any gain from the disposition of the foreclosure property, other than income that would otherwise be qualifying income for purposes of the 75% gross income test. Any gain from
the sale of property for which a foreclosure property election has been made will not be subject to the 100% tax on gains from prohibited transactions described above, even if the property would otherwise constitute inventory or dealer property in
the hands of the selling REIT. To the extent that we receive any income from foreclosure property that is not qualifying income for purposes of the 75% gross income test, we intend to make an election to treat the related property as foreclosure
property. </P>

obligations (liabilities) that have two or more maturities, and (iv)&nbsp;the payments required to be made by the entity on its debt obligations (liabilities) “bear a relationship” to the payments to be received by the entity on the debt
obligations that it holds as assets. Under Treasury Regulations, if less than 80% of the assets of an entity (or a portion of an entity) consist of debt obligations, these debt obligations are considered not to comprise “substantially all”
of its assets, and therefore the entity would not be treated as a TMP. Our financing and securitization arrangements may give rise to TMPs, with the consequences as described below. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Where an entity, or a portion of an entity, is classified as a TMP, it is generally treated as a taxable corporation for U.S.&nbsp;federal
income tax purposes. In the case of a REIT, or a portion of a REIT, or a disregarded subsidiary of a REIT, that is a TMP, however, special rules apply. We may enter into transactions that could result in us or a portion of our assets being treated
as a TMP for U.S.&nbsp;federal income tax purposes. Specifically, we may securitize our assets and such securitizations will likely result in us owning interests in a TMP. We would be precluded from holding equity interests in such a securitization
through our operating partnership. Accordingly, we would likely enter into such transactions at a subsidiary REIT level, and will be precluded from selling to outside investors equity interests in such securitizations or from selling any debt
securities issued in connection with such securitizations that might be considered to be equity interests for U.S.&nbsp;federal income tax purposes. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">If a REIT, including a subsidiary REIT formed by our operating partnership, owns, directly or indirectly through one or more qualified REIT
subsidiaries or other entities that are disregarded as a separate entity for U.S.&nbsp;federal income tax purposes 100% of the equity interests in the TMP, the TMP will be a qualified REIT subsidiary and, therefore, ignored as an entity separate
from the REIT for U.S.&nbsp;federal income tax purposes and would not generally affect the tax qualification of the REIT. Rather, the consequences of the TMP classification would generally, except as described below, be limited to the REIT’s
shareholders. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">If such a subsidiary REIT of our operating partnership owns less than 100% of the ownership interests in a subsidiary that
is a TMP, the foregoing rules would not apply. Rather, the subsidiary would be treated as a corporation for U.S.&nbsp;federal income tax purposes, and would be subject to corporate income tax. In addition, this characterization would alter the REIT
income and asset test calculations of such a subsidiary REIT and could adversely affect such REIT’s compliance with those requirements, which, in turn, could affect our compliance with the REIT requirements. We do not expect that we, or any
subsidiary REIT owned by our operating partnership, would form any subsidiary that would become a TMP, in which we own some, but less than all, of the ownership interests, and we intend to monitor the structure of any TMPs in which we have an
interest to ensure that they will not adversely affect our qualification as a REIT. If a subsidiary REIT through which we held TMP securitizations were to fail to qualify as a REIT, our TMP securitizations will be treated as separate taxable
corporations for U.S.&nbsp;federal income tax purposes that could not be included in any consolidated corporate tax return. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The

is not subject to unrelated business income tax (such as government entities), the REIT will be subject to tax on this income at the highest applicable corporate tax rate (currently 21%). In that case, the REIT could reduce distributions to such
shareholder by the amount of such tax paid by the REIT attributable to such shareholder’s ownership. Treasury Regulations provide that such a reduction in distributions would not give rise to a preferential dividend that could adversely affect
the REIT’s compliance with its distribution requirements. See “—Annual Distribution Requirements.” Our declaration of trust contemplates that any tax imposed on us in these circumstances may to the extent feasible reduce
distributions to the shareholder whose status caused that tax to be imposed, or we may bear such tax as a general corporate expense. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The

the method used by us, the amount of any excess inclusion income required to be taken into account by one or more shareholders (as described above) could be significantly increased. <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">Tax-exempt</FONT> investors,

individuals, trusts and estates from taxable C corporations. However, the Tax Act generally may allow such shareholders to deduct from their taxable income <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">one-fifth</FONT> of the Qualified REIT Dividends payable to
them for taxable years beginning after December&nbsp;31, 2017 and before January&nbsp;1, 2026. In addition, such shareholders are taxed at the preferential rates on dividends designated by and received from REITs to the extent that certain holding
requirements are met and the dividends are attributable to (i)&nbsp;income retained by the REIT in the prior taxable year on which the REIT was subject to corporate level income tax (less the amount of tax), (ii)&nbsp;dividends received by the REIT

they will be included in income as long-term capital gain, or short-term capital gain if the shares of beneficial interest have been held for one year or less. In addition, any dividend declared by us in October, November or December of any year and
payable to a shareholder of record on a specified date in any such month will be treated as both paid by us and received by the shareholder on December&nbsp;31 of such year, provided that the dividend is actually paid by us before the end of January

operating losses and capital losses carried forward from prior tax years, such losses may reduce the amount of distributions that must be made in order to comply with the REIT distribution requirements. See “ —Taxation of PennyMac Mortgage
Investment Trust—Annual Distribution Requirements.” Such losses, however, are not passed through to shareholders and do not offset income of shareholders from other sources. In addition, the Tax Act imposes certain limitations on the
deductibility of net operating losses. Any distributions made with respect to such tax years into which net operating losses have been carried forward from prior tax years will nevertheless be taxable as dividends to the extent of current earnings
or profits for such tax year. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In certain circumstances, we may make a taxable distribution of our shares of beneficial interest as part
of a distribution in which shareholders may elect to receive shares of beneficial interest or (subject to a limit measured as a percentage of the total distribution) cash. In this circumstance, a shareholder generally must include the sum of the
value of our shares of beneficial interest and the amount of cash received in its gross income as dividend income to the extent that such shareholder’s share of the distribution is made out of its share of the portion of our current and
accumulated earnings and profits allocable to such distribution. The value of any of our shares of beneficial interest received as part of a distribution is generally equal to the amount of cash that could have been received instead of our shares of
beneficial interest. Depending on the circumstances of the shareholder, the tax on the distribution may exceed the amount of the distribution received in cash, in which case such shareholder would have to pay the tax using cash from other sources. A
shareholder that received our shares of beneficial interest pursuant to a distribution generally has a tax basis in such shares of beneficial interest equal to the amount of cash that would have been received instead of our shares of beneficial
interest as described above, and a holding period in such shares of beneficial interest that begins on the day following the payment date for the distribution. </P>

interest generally will be treated as long-term capital gains and will be subject to a maximum U.S. federal income tax rate of 20%, not including the 3.8% Medicare tax described below, if the shares of beneficial interest are held for more than one
year, and will be treated as short-term capital gains taxed at substantially higher ordinary income rates (of up to 37% for taxable years beginning after December&nbsp;31, 2017 and before January&nbsp;1, 2026, not including such Medicare tax) if the
shares of beneficial interest are held for one year or less. Gains recognized by shareholders that are corporations are subject to U.S.&nbsp;federal income tax currently at a maximum rate of 21%, whether or not classified as long-term capital gains.
Capital losses recognized by a shareholder upon the disposition of our shares of beneficial interest held for more than one year at the time of disposition will be considered long-term capital losses, and are generally available only to offset
capital gain income of the shareholder but not ordinary income (except in the case of individuals, who may offset up to $3,000 of ordinary income each year). In addition, any loss upon a sale or exchange of our shares of beneficial interest by a
shareholder who has held the shares of beneficial interest for six months or less, after applying holding period rules, will be treated as a long-term capital loss to the extent of distributions received from us that are required to be treated by
the shareholder as long-term capital gain. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">If an investor recognizes a loss upon a subsequent disposition of our shares of beneficial
interest or other securities in an amount that exceeds a prescribed threshold, it is possible that the provisions of recently adopted Treasury Regulations involving “reportable transactions” could apply, with a resulting requirement to
separately disclose the loss generating transaction to the IRS. While these regulations are directed towards “tax shelters,” they are written quite broadly, and apply to transactions that would not typically be considered tax shelters. The
Internal Revenue Code imposes significant penalties for failure to comply with these requirements. Each shareholder is encouraged to consult with a tax advisor concerning any possible disclosure obligation with respect to the receipt or disposition
of our shares of beneficial interest or other securities, or transactions that might be undertaken directly or indirectly by us. Moreover, shareholders should be aware that we and other participants in the transactions involving us (including their
advisors) might be subject to disclosure or other requirements pursuant to these regulations. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Medicare Contribution Tax on Unearned

investment in those asset classes, and the direct receipt of interest and principal payments with respect to them, would not. The principal exceptions are foreign sovereigns and their agencies and instrumentalities, which may be exempt from

FIRPTA may also be subject to a 30% branch profits tax in the hands of a <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-U.S.</FONT> holder that is a corporation. However, a distribution is not a USRPI capital gain if the underlying asset that was sold
represented an interest held by us solely as a creditor, and is therefore not a USRPI, which is likely to be the case for a substantial majority of our assets. Capital gain dividends received by a <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-U.S.</FONT>

not be subject to U.S.&nbsp;taxation under FIRPTA. Our shares of beneficial interest will not be treated as a USRPI if less than 50% of our assets throughout a prescribed testing period consist of interests in real property located within the U.S.,
excluding, for this purpose, interests in real property held solely as a creditor. We expect that most of our assets throughout any relevant testing period will not be real property, but instead will constitute debt instruments, or securities

association taxable as a corporation or as a partnership. If such an entity does not make an election, it generally will be treated as a partnership for U.S.&nbsp;federal income tax purposes. We intend that our operating partnership and any other
partnership or limited liability company in which we hold an interest will be classified as a partnership for U.S.&nbsp;federal income tax purposes (or else a disregarded entity where there are not at least two separate beneficial owners). </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">A publicly traded partnership is a partnership whose interests are traded on an established securities market or are readily tradable on a
secondary market (or a substantial equivalent). A publicly traded partnership is generally treated as a corporation for U.S.&nbsp;federal income tax purposes, but will not be so treated for any taxable year for which at least 90% of the
partnership’s gross income consists of specified passive income, including real property rents, gains from the sale or other disposition of real property, interest, and dividends (the “90% passive income exception”). Our operating
partnership will be structured, operated and maintained so as not to be treated as a “publicly traded partnership.” We have not requested, and do not intend to request, a ruling from the IRS that our operating partnership and any other
partnership or limited liability company in which we hold an interest will be classified as partnerships that are not taxable as corporations for U.S.&nbsp;federal income tax purposes. If for any reason our operating partnership or any other
partnership or limited liability company in which we hold an interest were taxable as a corporation, rather than as a partnership, for U.S.&nbsp;federal income tax purposes, we might not qualify as a REIT. See “—Taxation of PennyMac
Mortgage Investment Trust—Income Tests,” “—Taxation of PennyMac Mortgage Investment Trust—Asset Tests” and “—Taxation of PennyMac Mortgage Investment Trust—Failure to Qualify.” In addition, any
change in a partnership’s status for tax purposes might be treated as a taxable event, in which case we might incur tax liability without any related cash distribution. See “—Taxation of PennyMac Mortgage Investment Trust—Annual
Distribution Requirements.” Further, items of income and deduction of such partnership would not pass through to its partners, and its partners would be treated as shareholders for tax purposes. Consequently, such partnership would be required
to pay income tax at corporate rates on its net income, and distributions to its partners would constitute dividends that would not be deductible in computing such partnership’s taxable income. </P>
